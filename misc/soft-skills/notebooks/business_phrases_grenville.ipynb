There was something so kindly in its easy candor; There was spendthrift grandeur; These qualities were raised to the white heat of enthusiasm; They became increasingly turbid and phantasmagorical [phantasmagorical = fantastic imagery];

Touched with a bewildering and elusive beauty; Transcendental contempt for money; Transformed with an overmastering passion; Trouble gathered on his brow; Turning the world topsy-turvey; Twilight creeps upon the darkening mind;\n",

Like a summer cloud, youth indeed has crept away; Like a summer-dried fountain; Like a swift eagle in the morning glare breasting the whirlwind with impetuous flight; Like a thing at rest; Like a thing read in a book or remembered out of the faraway past; Like a tide of triumph through their veins, the red, rejoicing blood began to race; Like a triumphing fire the news was borne; Like a troop of boys let loose from school, the adventurers went by; Like a vaporous amethyst; Like a vision of the morning air; Like a voice from the unknown regions; Like a wandering star I fell through the deeps of desire; Like a watch-worn and weary sentinel; Like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed; Like a whirlwind they went past; Like a withered leaf the moon is blown across the bay; Like a world of sunshine; Like a yellow silken scarf the thick fog hangs; Like an alien ghost I stole away; Like an eagle clutching his prey, his arm swooped down; Like an eagle dallying with the wind; Like an engine of dread war, he set his shoulder to the mountain-side; Like an enraged tiger; Like an enthusiast leading about with him an indifferent tourist; Like an icy wave, a swift and tragic impression swept through him; Like an unbidden guest; Like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun; Like an unseen star of birth; Like an unwelcome thought; Like apparitions seen and gone; Like attempting to number the waves on the snore of a limitless sea; Like bells that waste the moments with their loudness; Like blasts of trumpets blown in wars; Like bright Apollo; Like bright lamps, the fabled apples glow; Like building castles in the air; Like bursting waves from the ocean; Like cliffs which have been rent asunder; Like clouds of gnats with perfect lineaments [lineaments = distinctive shape]; Like cobwebs woven round the limbs of an infant giant; Like crystals of snow; Like dead lovers who died true; Like Death, who rides upon a thought, and makes his way through temple, tower, and palace; Like dew upon a sleeping flower; Like dining with a ghost; Like drawing nectar in a sieve; Like earth's decaying leaves; Like echoes from a hidden lyre; Like echoes from an antenatal dream; Like fixed eyes, whence the dear light of sense and thought has fled; Like footsteps upon wool; Like fragrance from dead flowers; Like ghosts, from an enchanter fleeing; Like ghosts the sentries come and go; Like golden boats on a sunny sea; Like great black birds, the demons haunt the woods; Like green waves on the sea; Like having to taste a hundred exquisite dishes in a single meal; Like Heaven's free breath, which he who grasps can hold not; Like helpless birds in the warm nest; Like iridescent bubbles floating on a foul stream; Like kindred drops mingled into one; Like laying a burden on the back of a moth; Like lead his feet were; Like leaves in wintry weather; Like leviathans afloat; Like lighting a candle to the sun; Like making a mountain out of a mole-hill; Like mariners pulling the life-boat; Like mice that steal in and out as if they feared the light; Like mountain over mountain huddled; Like mountain streams we meet and part; Like music on the water; Like notes which die when born, but still haunt the echoes of the hill; Like oceans of liquid silver; Like one pale star against the dusk, a single diamond on her brow gleamed with imprisoned fire; Like one who halts with tired wings; Like one who talks of what he loves in dream; Like organ music came the deep reply; Like pageantry of mist on an autumnal stream; Like phantoms gathered by the sick imagination; Like planets in the sky; Like pouring oil on troubled waters; Like roses that in deserts bloom and die; Like rowing upstream against a strong downward current; Like scents from a twilight garden; Like separated souls; Like serpents struggling in a vulture's grasp; Like sheep from out the fold of the sky, stars leapt; Like ships that have gone down at sea; Like shy elves hiding from the traveler's eye; Like skeletons, the sycamores uplift their wasted hands; Like some grave night thought threading a dream; Like some new-gathered snowy hyacinth, so white and cold and delicate it was; Like some poor nigh-related guest, that may not rudely be dismist; Like some suppressed and hideous thought which flits athwart our musings, but can find no rest within a pure and gentle mind; Like some unshriven churchyard thing, the friar crawled; Like something fashioned in a dream; Like sounds of wind and flood; Like splendor-winged moths about a taper; Like stepping out on summer evenings from the glaring ball-room; upon the cool and still piazza; Like straws in a gust of wind; Like summer's beam and summer's stream; Like sunlight, in and out the leaves, the robins went; Like sweet thoughts in a dream; Like the awful shadow of some unseen power; Like the bellowing of bulls; Like the boar encircled by hunters and hounds; Like the bubbles on a river sparkling, bursting, borne away; Like the cold breath of the grave; Like the creaking of doors held stealthily ajar; Like the cry of an itinerant vendor in a quiet and picturesque town; Like the dance of some gay sunbeam; Like the dawn of the morn; Like the detestable and spidery araucaria [araucaria = evergreen trees of South America and Australia]; Like the dew on the mountain; Like the dim scent in violets; Like the drifting foam of a restless sea when the waves show their teeth in the flying breeze; Like the embodiment of a perfect rose, complete in form and fragrance; Like the faint cry of unassisted woe; Like the faint exquisite music of a dream; Like the fair flower dishevel'd in the wind; Like the fair sun, when in his fresh array he cheers the morn, and all the earth revealeth; Like the falling thud of the blade of a murderous ax; Like the fierce fiend of a distempered dream; Like the fitting of an old glove to a hand; Like the foam on the river; Like the great thunder sounding; Like the jangling of all the strings of some musical instrument; Like the jewels that gleam in baby eyes; Like the kiss of maiden love the breeze is sweet and bland; Like the long wandering love, the weary heart may faint for rest; Like the moon in water seen by night; Like the music in the patter of small feet; Like the prodigal whom wealth softens into imbecility; Like the quivering image of a landscape in a flowing stream; Like the rainbow, thou didst fade; Like the rustling of grain moved by the west-wind; Like the sap that turns to nectar, in the velvet of the peach; Like the sea whose waves are set in motion by the winds; Like the sea-worm, that perforates the shell of the mussel, which straightway closes the wound with a pearl; Like the setting of a tropical sun; Like the shadow of a great hill that reaches far out over the plain; Like the shadows of the stars in the upheaved sea; Like the shudder of a doomed soul; Like the silver gleam when the poplar trees rustle their pale leaves listlessly; Like the soft light of an autumnal day; Like the Spring-time, fresh and green; Like the stern-lights of a ship at sea, illuminating only the path which has been passed over; Like the sudden impulse of a madman; Like the swell of Summer's ocean; Like the tattered effigy in a cornfield; Like the vase in which roses have once been distill'd; Like the visits of angels, short and far between; Like the whole sky when to the east the morning doth return; Like thistles of the wilderness, fit neither for food nor fuel; Like those great rivers, whose course everyone beholds, but their springs have been seen by but few; Like thoughts whose very sweetness yielded proof that they were born for immortality; Like to diamonds her white teeth shone between the parted lips; Like torrents from a mountain source, we rushed into each other's arms; Like troops of ghosts on the dry wind past; Like two doves with silvery wings, let our souls fly; Like two flaming stars were his eyes; Like vaporous shapes half seen; Like village curs that bark when their fellows do; Like wasted hours of youth; Like winds that bear sweet music, when they breathe through some dim latticed chamber; Like wine-stain to a flask the old distrust still clings; Like winged stars the fire-flies flash and glance; Like young lovers whom youth and love make dear; Lingering like an unloved guest; Lithe as a panther; Little white hands like pearls; Lofty as a queen; Loneliness struck him like a blow; Looked back with faithful eyes like a great mastiff to his master's face; Looking as sulky as the weather itself; Looking like a snarling beast baulked of its prey [baulked = checked, thwarted]; Loose clouds like earth's decaying leaves are shed; Lost like the lightning in the sullen clod; Love as clean as starlight; Love brilliant as the morning; Love had like the canker-worm consumed her early prime; Love is a changing lord as the light on a turning sword; Love like a child around the world doth run; Love like a miser in the dark his joys would hide; Love shakes like a windy reed your heart; Love smiled like an unclouded sun; Love that sings and has wings as a bird; Lovely as starry water; Lovely the land unknown and like a river flowing;\n",

She brightened like a child whose broken toy is glued together; She could summon tears as one summons servants; She danced like a flower in the wind; She disclaimed the weariness that dragged upon her spirits like leaden weights; She exuded a faint and intoxicating perfume of womanliness, like a crushed herb; She felt like an unrepentant criminal; She fled like a spirit from the room; She flounders like a huge conger-eel in an ocean of dingy morality; She gave him a surprised look, like a child catching an older person in a foolish statement; She gave off antipathies as a liquid gives off vapor; She has great eyes like the doe; She heard him like one in a dream; She let the soft waves of her deep hair fall like flowers from Paradise; She looked like a tall golden candle; She looked like the picture of a young rapt saint, lost in heavenly musing; She moved like mirth incarnate; She nestles like a dove; She played with a hundred possibilities fitfully and discursively as a musician runs his fingers over a key-board; She played with grave cabinets as a cat plays with a mouse; She saw this planet like a star hung in the glistening depths of even; She seemed as happy as a wave that dances on the sea; She shall be sportive as the fawn; She stood silent a moment, dropping before him like a broken branch; She that passed had lips like pinks; She walked like a galley-slave; She walks in beauty like the night; She was as brilliant, and as hard too, as electric light; She was silent, standing before him like a little statuesque figure;

Slowly moved off and disappeared like shapes breathed on a mirror and melting away; Slowly, unnoted, like the creeping rust that spreads insidious, had estrangement come; Small as a grain of mustard seed; Smooth as a pond; Smooth as the pillar flashing in the sun; Snug as a bug in a rug; Soaring as swift as smoke from a volcano springs; So elusive that the memory of it afterwards was wont to come and go like a flash of light; So my spirit beat itself like a caged bird against its prison bars in vain; Soft as a zephyr; Soft as sleep the snow fell; Soft as Spring; Soft as the down of the turtle dove; Soft as the landscape of a dream; Soft as the south-wind; Soft in their color as gray pearls; Soft vibrations of verbal melody, like the sound of a golden bell rung far down under the humming waters; Some gleams of feeling pure and warm as sunshine on a sky of storm; Some like veiled ghosts hurrying past as though driven to their land of shadows by shuddering fear; Some minds are like an open fire—how direct and instant our communication with them; Something divine seemed to cling around her like some subtle vapor; Something resistant and inert, like the obstinate rolling over of a heavy sleeper after he has been called to get up; Something sharp and brilliant, like the glitter of a sword or a forked flash of lightning;

Sunbeams flashing on the face of things like sudden smilings of divine delight; Sunday mornings which seem to put on, like a Sabbath garment, an atmosphere of divine quietude; Supple and sweet as a rose in bloom;

    "The day stunned me like light upon some wizard way; The day was sweeter than honey and the honey-comb; The day have trampled me like armed men; The dead past flew away over the fens like a flight of wild swans; The deep like one black maelstrom round her whirls; The deepening east like a scarlet poppy burnt; The desolate rocky hills rolled like a solid wave along the horizon; The dome of heaven is like one drop of dew; The dreams of poets come like music heard at evening from the depth of some enchanted forest; The eagerness faded from his eyes, leaving them cold as a winter sky after sunset; The earth was like a frying-pan, or some such hissing matter; The eternal sea, which like a childless mother, still must croon her ancient sorrows to the cold white moon; The evening sky was as green as jade; The excitement had spread through the whole house, like a piquant and agreeable odor; The excitement of the thought buoyed his high-strung temperament like a tonic; The feathery meadows like a lilac sea; The firm body like a slope of snow; The first whiff of reality dissipated them like smoke; The floor, newly waxed, gleamed in the candle-light like beaten moonbeams; The fragrant clouds of hair, they flowed round him like a snare; The gathering glory of life shone like the dawn; The gesture was all strength and will, like the stretching of a sea-bird's wings; The girl's voice rang like a bird-call through his rustling fancies; The glimmer of tall flowers standing like pensive moon-worshipers in an ecstasy of prayerless bloom; The guides sniffed, like chamois, the air ;   [chamois = extremely agile goat antelope] ;The heavens are like a scroll unfurled; The hills across the valley were purple as thunder-clouds; The hoofs of the horses rang like the dumb cadence of an old saga; The hours crawled by like years; The hum of the camp sounds like the sea; The hurrying crowds of men gather like clouds; The ideas succeeded each other like a dynasty of kings; The impalpable presence of the new century rose like a vast empty house through which; no human feet had walked; The inexorable facts closed in on him like prison-warders hand-cuffing a convict; The lake glimmered as still as a mirror; The land of gold seemed to hold him like a spell; The land was like a dream; The level boughs, like bars of iron across the setting sun; The light of London flaring like a dreary dawn; The lights blazed up like day; The lilies were drooping, white, and wan, like the head and skin of a dying man; The mellowing hand of time; The melody rose tenderly and lingeringly like a haunting perfume of pressed flowers; The Milky Way lay like diamond-dust upon the robe of some great king; The monk's face whitened like sea-foam; The moon drowsed between the trees like a great yellow moth; The moon on the tower slept soft as snow; The moonbeams rest like a pale spotless shroud; The moonlight lay like snow; The moonlight, like a fairy mist, upon the mesa spreads; The mortal coldness of the soul, like death itself comes down; The mountain shadows mingling, lay like pools above the earth; The mountains loomed up dimly, like phantoms through the mist; The music almost died away, then it burst like a pent-up flood; The name that cuts into my soul like a knife; The nervous little train winding its way like a jointed reptile; The new ferns were spread upon the earth like some lacy coverlet; The night like a battle-broken host is driven before; The night yawned like a foul wind; The ocean swelled like an undulating mirror of the bowl of heaven; The old books look somewhat pathetically from the shelves, like aged dogs wondering why no one takes them for a walk; The old infamy will pop into daylight like a toad out of fissure in the rock; The penalty falls like a thunderbolt from heaven; The phrase was like a spear-thrust; The pine trees waved as waves a woman's hair; The place was like some enchanted town of palaces; The plains to northward change their color like the shimmering necks of doves; The poppy burned like a crimson ember; The prime of man has waxed like cedars; The public press would chatter and make odd ambiguous sounds like a shipload of monkeys in a storm; The purple heather rolls like dumb thunder; The rainbows flashed like fire; The river shouted as ever its cry of joy over the vitality of life, like a spirited boy before the face of inscrutable nature; The roofs with their gables like hoods; The roses lie upon the grass like little shreds of crimson silk; The satire of the word cut like a knife; The scullion with face shining like his pans; The sea reeled round like a wine-vat splashing; The sea-song of the trampling waves is as muffled bells; The sea spread out like a wrinkled marble floor; The sea, that gleamed still, like a myriad-petaled rose; The sea was as untroubled as the turquoise vault which it reflected; The setting of the sun is like a word of peace; The sharp hail rattles against the panes and melts on my cheeks like tears; The ships, like sheeted phantoms coming and going; The silence seemed to crush to earth like a great looking-glass and shiver into a million pieces; The silvery morning like a tranquil vision fills the world; The sky burned like a heated opal; The sky gleamed with the hardness and brilliancy of blue enamel; The sky was as a shield that caught the stain of blood and battle from the dying sun; The sky was clear and blue, and the air as soft as milk; The sky was like a peach; The sky where stars like lilies white and fair shine through the mists; The solid air around me there heaved like a roaring ocean; The solid mountains gleamed like the unsteady sea; The soul is like a well of water springing up into everlasting life; The sound is like a noon-day gale; The sound is like a silver-fountain that springeth in a golden basin; The sound of a thousand tears, like softly pattering wings; The sound of your running feet that like the sea-hoofs beat; The spear-tongued lightning slipped like a snake; The Spring breaks like a bird; The stacks of corn in brown array, like tattered wigwams on the plain; The stars come down and trembling glow like blossoms on the waves below; The stars lay on the lapis-lazuli sky ; like white flower-petals on still deep water ;[lapis-lazuli = opaque to translucent blue,violet-blue, or greenish-blue gemstone] ;The stars pale and silent as a seer; The strange cold sense of aloofness that had numbed her senses suddenly gave way like snow melting in the spring; The sudden thought of your face is like a wound when it comes unsought; The sun, like a great dragon, writhes in gold; The sun on the sea-wave lies white as the moon; The surf was like the advancing lines of an unknown enemy flinging itself upon the shore; The terrible past lay afar, like a dream left behind in the night; The tide was in the salt-weed, and like a knife it tore; The time, gliding like a dream; The torrent from the hills leaped down their rocky stairways like wild steeds; The tree whose plumed boughs are soft as wings of birds; The uproar and contention pierced him like arrows; The veiled future bowed before me like a vision of promise; The velvet grass that is like padding to earth's meager ribs; The villa dips its foot in the lake, smiling at its reflection like a bather lingering on the brink; The voice of Fate, crying like some old Bellman through the world; The voice that rang in the night like a bugle call; The warm kindling blood burned her cheeks like the breath of a hot wind; The waves were rolling in, long and lazy, like sea-worn travelers; The whole truth, naked, cold, and fatal as a patriot's blade; The wind all round their ears hissed like a flight of white-winged geese; The wind comes and it draws its length along like the genii from the earthen pot; The wine flows like blood; The woman seemed like a thing of stone; The words kept ringing in my ears like the tolling of a bell; The words of the wise fall like the tolling of sweet, grave bells upon the soul; The world had vanished like a phantasmagoria; The world is bitter as a tear; The world is in a simmer, like a sea; The world wavers within its circle like a dream; The years stretched before her like some vast blank page out to receive the record of her toil; The years vanished like a May snowdrift; The yellow apples glowed like fire; Their glances met like crossed swords; Their joy like sunshine deep and broad falls on my heart; Their minds rested upon the thought, as chasing butterflies might rest together on a flower; Their music frightful as the serpent's hiss; Their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting; Then fall unheeded like the faded flower; Then felt I like some watcher of the skies; Then it swelled out to rich and glorious harmonies like a full orchestra playing under the sea; Then the lover sighing like furnace; Theories sprouted in his mind like mushrooms; There is an air about you like the air that folds a star; There, like a bird, it sits and sings; There seemed to brood in the air a quiet benevolence of a Father watching His myriad children at play; There she soars like a seraph; There she stood straight as a lily on its stem; There slowly rose to sight, a country like a dragon fast asleep; There streamed into the air the sweet smell of crushed grass, as though many fields had been pressed between giant's fingers and so had been left; These eyes like stars have led me; These final words snapped like a whip-lash; These thoughts pierced me like thorns; They are as cruel as creeping tigers; They are as white foam on the swept sands; They are as white swans in the dusk, thy white hands; They are painted sharp as death; They broke into pieces and fell on the ground, like a silvery, shimmering shower of hail; They dropped like panthers; They fly like spray; They had hands like claws; They had slipped away like visions; They have as many principles as a fish has bones; They have faces like flowers; They hurried down like plovers that have heard the call [plovers = wading birds]; They look like rose-buds filled with snow; They seem like swarming flies, the crowd of little men; They seemed like floating flowers; They shine as sweet as simple doves; They stand like solitary mountain forms on some hard, perfectly transparent day; They vanished like the shapes that float upon a summer's dream; Thick as wind-blown leaves innumerable; Thickly the flakes drive past, each like a childish ghost; Thine eyes like two twin stars shining; This life is like a bubble blown up in the air; This love that dwells like moonlight in your face; This thought is as death; This tower rose in the sunset like a prayer; Those ancestral themes past which so many generations have slept like sea-going winds over pastures; Those death-like eyes, unconscious of the sun; Those eyelids folded like a white rose-leaf; Those eyes like bridal beacons shine; Thou art to me but as a wave of the wild sea; Thou as heaven art fair and young; Thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea; Thou must wither like a rose; Thou shalt be as free as mountain winds; Thou wouldst weep tears bitter as blood; Though bright as silver the meridian beams shine; Though thou be black as night; Thoughts vague as the fitful breeze; Three-cornered notes fly about like butterflies; Through the forest, like a fairy dream through some dark mind, the ferns in branching beauty stream; Through the moonlit trees, like ghosts of sounds haunting the moonlight, stole the faint tinkle of a guitar; Through the riot of his senses, like a silver blaze, ran the legend; Thy beauty like a beast it bites; Thy brown benignant eyes have sudden gleams of gladness and surprise, like woodland brooks that cross a sunlit spot; Thy carven columns must have grown by magic, like a dream in stone; Thy favors are but like the wind that kisses everything it meets; Thy heart is light as a leaf of a tree; Thy name burns like a gray and flickering candle flame; Thy name will be as honey on men's lips; Till death like sleep might steal on me; Till he melted like a cloud in the silent summer heaven; Time drops in decay, like a candle burnt out; Time like a pulse shakes fierce; To drag life on, which like a heavy chain lengthens behind with many a link of pain; To forsake as the trees drop their leaves in autumn; Toys with smooth trifles like a child at play; Transitory as clouds without substance; Transparent like a shining sun; Tree and shrub altered their values and became transmuted to silver sentinels; Trees that spread their forked boughs like a stag's antlers; Trembling like an aspen-leaf; Truths which forever shine as fixed stars; Turning easily and securely as on a perfect axle;\n",

    "Unbends like a loosened bow; Unbreakable as iron; Unconscious as an oak-tree of its growth; Under the willow-tree glimmered her face like a foam-flake drifting over the sea; Unheralded, like some tornado loosed out of the brooding hills, it came to pass; Unknown, like a seed in fallow ground, was the germ of a plan; Unmoving as a tombstone; Untameable as flies; Unutterable things pressing on my soul like a pent-up storm craving for outlet; Upcast like foam of the effacing tide; Uplifting the soul as on dovelike wings; Uplifting their stony peaks around us like the walls and turrets of a gigantic fortress; Urgent as the seas; Uttering wild cries like a creature in pain;\n",

    "Vague as a dream; Vague thoughts that stream shapelessly through her mind like long sad vapors through the twilight sky; Vanish into thin air, like ghosts at the cockcrow; Vanished like snow when comes a thaw; Vanished like vapor before the sun; Vibrations set quivering like harp strings struck by the hand of a master; Vociferous praise following like a noisy wave;\n",

    "Walking somewhat unsteadily like a blind man feeling his way; Waves glittered and danced on all sides like millions of diamonds; We left her and retraced our steps like faithless hounds; Weak and frail like the vapor of a vale; Wearing their wounds like stars; Weary wind, who wanderest like the world's rejected guest; When a draft might puff them out like a guttering candle ;       [guttering = To melt through the side of the hollow in a candle ;        formed by a burning wick; to burn low and unsteadily; flicker] ;When arm in arm they both came swiftly running, like a pair of turtle-doves that could not live asunder day or night; When cards, invitations, and three-corn'd notes fly about like white butterflies; When she died, her breath whistled like the wind in a keyhole; When the fever pierced me like a knife; Where a lamp of deathless beauty shines like a beacon; Where heroes die as leaves fall; Where the intricate wheels of trade are grinding on, like a mill; Where the source of the waters is fine as a thread; Whilst the lagging hours of the day went by like windless clouds o'er a tender sky; Whistled sharply in the air like a handful of vipers; White as a ghost from darkness; White as chalk; White as dove or lily, or spirit of the light; White as the driven snow; White as the moon's white flame; White as the sea-bird's wing; White clouds like daisies; White hands she moves like swimming swans; White hands through her hair, like white doves going into the shadow of a wood; White like flame; White sails of sloops like specters; Whose bodies are as strong as alabaster; Whose hair was as gold raiment on a king; Whose laugh moves like a bat through silent haunted woods; Whose little eyes glow like the sparks of fire; Whose music like a robe of living light reclothed each new-born age; Windy speech which hits all around the mark like a drunken carpenter; Winged like an arrow to its mark; With a sting like a scorpion; With all the complacency of a homeless cat; With an angry broken roar, like billows on an unseen shore, their fury burst; With hate darkling as the swift winter hail; With music sweet as love; With sounds like breakers; With strength like steel; With the whisper of leaves in one's ear; With words like honey melting from the comb; Wits as sharp as gimlets [gimlet = small hand tool for boring holes]; Women with tongues like polar needles; Words as fresh as spring verdure [verdure = lush greenness of flourishing vegetation]; Words as soft as rain; Words like the gossamer film of the summer; Words sweet as honey from his lips distill'd; Words were flashing like brilliant birds through the boughs overhead; Wordsworth, thy music like a river rolls; Worthless like the conjurer's gold; Wrangle over details like a grasping pawnbroker; Wrinkled and scored like a dried apple; Writhing with an intensity that burnt like a steady flame;\n",

    "Yielding like melted snow; Yonder flimsy crescent, bent like an archer's bow above the snowy summit; You are as gloomy to-night as an undertaker out of employment; You are as hard as stone; You gave me such chill embraces as the snow-covered heights receive from clouds; Your blood is red like wine; Your charms lay like metals in a mine; Your eyes are like fantastic moons that shiver in some stagnant lake; Your eyes as blue as violets; Your eyes they were green and gray like an April day; Your frail fancies are swallowed up, like chance flowers flung upon the river's current; Your hair was golden as tints of sunrise; Your heart is as dry as a reed; Your locks are like the raven; Your love shall fall about me like sweet rain; Your step's like the rain to summer vexed farmer; Your thoughts are buzzing like a swarm of bees; Your tongue is like a scarlet snake; Your voice had a quaver in it just like the linnet [linnet = small finch]; Youth like a summer morn; "
