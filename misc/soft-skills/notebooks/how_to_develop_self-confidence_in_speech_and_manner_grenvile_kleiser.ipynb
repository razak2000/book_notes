    "# PREFACE\n",
    "The purpose of this book is to inspire in men lofty ideals. It is particularly for those who daily\n",
    "defraud themselves because of doubt, fearthought, and foolish timidity.\n",
    "Thousands of persons are held in physical and mental bondage, owing to lack of\n",
    "self-confidence. Distrusting themselves, they live a life of limited effort, and at last pass on\n",
    "without having realized more than a small part of their rich possessions. It is believed that this\n",
    "book will be of substantial service to those who wish to rise above mediocrity, and who feel\n",
    "within them something of their divine inheritance. It is commended with confidence to every\n",
    "ambitious man.\n",

    "# Chapter I\n",
    "## PRELIMINARY STEPS\n",
    "\n",
    "The development of self-confidence begins properly with <font color='blue'> intelligent self-examination. </font> The\n",
    "mind must be closely scrutinized, undesirable tendencies checked; faults eradicated, and\n",
    "correct habits of thought and conduct firmly established.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> To achieve the best results this personal overhauling, or stock-taking, should be thorough and\n",
    "fearless. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> Fear thought is a disease </font>, to be diagnosed as carefully as any other malady. <font color='blue'> It arises largely\n",
    "from perverted mental habits. </font> The <font color='blue'> mind is permitted habitually to dwell upon thoughts of\n",
    "doubt, failure, and inefficiency. So great does this power become, when permitted to rule\n",
    "unchecked, that it affects to greater or less degree almost every act of one's life. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> The extremes to which timidity will sometimes go are as amusing as they are absurd. </font> Men fear\n",
    "poverty, darkness, ridicule, microbes, insomnia, dogs, lightning, burglars, cold, solitude,\n",
    "marriage, Friday, lawyers, death, thirteen, accident, and ghosts. The catalog of dreaded\n",
    "possibilities might include black cats, mice, ill luck, criticism, travel, disease, evil eyes, dreams,\n",
    "and old age.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> It is true there is a legitimate and honest fear </font>, like that of the young soldier who, upon being\n",
    "asked after his first battle how he felt, replied: \"I was afraid I would be afraid, but I was not\n",
    "afraid.\" <font color='blue'> It is right and proper that one should fear to do a mean or cowardly thing, to injure\n",
    "another, or to commit any kind of wrong. This fear, however, instead of weakening personal\n",
    "character, imparts to it new and manly force. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> To walk straight up to the thing feared will often strip it of its terror. </font> In one of the old fables\n",
    "we read that when man first beheld the camel its huge size caused him to flee in dreadful fear.\n",
    "\n",
    "But later, observing the animal's seeming gentleness, he approached him less timidly, and then,\n",
    "seeing the almost spiritless nature of the beast, he boldly put a bridle in his mouth and set a\n",
    "child to drive him. We can in like manner conquer fear thoughts of the human mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> Fear has well been called our most ancient enemy. </font> Primitive humanity were unprotected\n",
    "against more powerful animals, and in those early days they had good reason, doubtless, for\n",
    "manifesting (great fear; but it is difficult to justify the wide-spread fear that exists to-day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thousands of persons can say truthfully: \"I have all my life feared things that never\n",
    "happened.\" <font color='blue'> The danger of this fear attitude is that it frequently attracts that which is dreaded\n",
    "most </font>, and the words of Job are literally fulfilled: \"For the thing which I greatly feared is come\n",
    "upon me and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.\" We are told that one of the bravest\n",
    "of African chiefs was driven into a cold sweat of agonizing fear merely by the constant ticking\n",
    "of a watch.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> If worry is due to lack of self-reliance, fear is an acknowledgment of inferiority. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> It does not stand still, and unless throttled will gradually overwhelm its victim, </font> making him at\n",
    "last \"Like one, that on a lonesome road Doth walk in fear and dread, And having once turned\n",
    "round walks on, And turns no more his head; Because he knows a frightful fiend Doth close\n",
    "behind him tread.<font color='blue'> \"Timidity is quickly recognized by the world, and not only argues an ignoble mind, as Virgil\n",
    "says, but actually invites pursuit and imposition. </font> John Foster observes in his splendid essay \"On\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision of Character \": <font color='blue'> Weakness, in every form, tempts arrogance; </font> and a man may be\n",
    "allowed to wish for a kind of character with which stupidity and impertinence may not make so\n",
    "free. When a firm, decisive spirit is recognized, it is curious to see how the space clears around\n",
    "a man, and leaves him room and freedom. The disposition to interrogate, dictate, or banter,\n",
    "preserves a respectful and polite distance, judging it not unwise to keep the peace with a\n",
    "person of so much energy.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> It is surprising how confidence begets confidence. </font> <font color='blue'> Courage in danger is sometimes half the\n",
    "battle, while self-reliance will often safeguard a man's interests and give him an abiding sense\n",
    "of security. </font> <font color='blue'> It makes him feel equal to almost any undertaking, however difficult, </font> leading him\n",
    "to think with Dry den that \"They can conquer who believe they can.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> The building of self-confidence is not difficult, but it requires patience and intelligent effort. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> There should be no straining, no anxiety, and no haste. </font> The story of the man who tried to jump\n",
    "over a hill should be kept in mind. He went a long way back, then ran so hard toward the hill\n",
    "that when he got there he was obliged to lie down and rest. Then he got up and walked over\n",
    "the hill. <font color='blue'> Many men are always preparing, but never achieving. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is said that with regard to any final or definite end, most men live at hazard, and without any\n",
    "fixed star to guide them. Hence, as a writer has expressed it, \"To him that knoweth not the\n",
    "port to which he is bound, no wind can be favorable; neither can he who has not yet\n",
    "determined at what mark he is to shoot, direct his arrow aright.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> Indecision is a frequent cause of the fear habit. Men hesitate to take a step one way or the\n",
    "other lest they do the wrong thing, and this spirit of irresolution and hesitation often leads them\n",
    "into the very mistakes they would avoid. </font> <font color='blue'> It is like a man on a bicycle, </font> endeavoring to steer\n",
    "clear of an obstruction on the road, but all the while keeping his eye fastened upon it so that a\n",
    "collision is inevitable. <font color='blue'> There is nothing more disastrous to manbuilding than infirmity of\n",
    "purpose. \"He who hesitates is lost,\" </font> while he grows great who puts on \"the dauntless spirit of\n",
    "resolution.\" <font color='blue'> The world generally accepts a man at his own valuation. </font> <font color='blue'> If you give an impression\n",
    "that you are afraid, you will beside-elbowed and imposed upon at almost every turn. </font> Let me\n",
    "illustrate: The other day I saw a dog leisurely pass a cat on the street, and to all appearance\n",
    "there was no ill feeling on either side. The cat looked him straight in the eye as he approached,\n",
    "and the dog returned her confident glance and quietly passed on. Then the cat, seeing a good\n",
    "chance for escape, bolted across the street, but the instant the dog saw her running he turned\n",
    "and followed in hot haste. It was cat and dog for some yards, when suddenly the cat stopped,\n",
    "humped her back and looked defiantly at her adversary. He stopped, caught his breath, blinked\n",
    "uncertainly, turned up his nose, and walked off. <font color='blue'> As long as the cat showed fear and ran, the\n",
    "dog chased her; but the moment she took her stand, he respected her. </font> <font color='blue'> When a man stands up\n",
    "boldly and sell-confidently for his rights, fear slinks tremblingly into the shadows. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> You, who enter upon this study of self-confidence, resolve to follow it to completion with\n",
    "bulldog tenacity. Realize that no weak-hearted, intermittent efforts will achieve your desired\n",
    "purpose. </font> <font color='blue'> Hold before you the supreme assurance that you can and will achieve this\n",
    "indispensable power, and great will be the reward of your energy and perseverance. </font>"

    "## BUILDING THE WILL\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> The importance of will-power is recognized by most men, </font> yet few deliberately give any time or\n",
    "thought to its development. <font color='blue'> Why we resist one thing and yield to another, may be due to \"the\n",
    "strongest motive,\" </font> but what more particularly concerns us in the study of self-confidence is in\n",
    "<font color='blue'> what way this mighty power can be built and directed. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> Does desire control the will, or will desire? </font> <font color='blue'> The psychologist points to the testimony of\n",
    "consciousness as confirming our freedom to choose a certain course and to pursue it, with the\n",
    "feeling that we could choose some other course if we desired. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "In either event, there is no feeling of compulsion, and this would seem to confirm the idea of\n",
    "freedom of will.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> Let desire, then, be the starting-point of the student's attempt to educate his will. To strengthen\n",
    "immediately his desire for a strong will, he should dwell intently upon the advantages this\n",
    "power will confer upon him. </font> He should think deeply upon the <font color='blue'> satisfaction that will come </font> to him\n",
    "from doing things definitely and promptly, and the <font color='blue'> increased self-confidence that will surely\n",
    "follow from the habit </font> of finishing in a thorough manner everything he undertakes. <font color='blue'> By dwelling\n",
    "long and earnestly upon the inestimable value of a strong, well-directed will, there will grow in\n",
    "his mind an intense desire to possess this faculty, to use it to his daily advantage, and finally by\n",
    "its aid to realize his life's ambition. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> There are many things we desire to avoid </font>, such as poverty, pain, misfortune, and ill-health;\n",
    "<font color='blue'> while there are things we much desire to have </font>, such as wealth, power, knowledge, and\n",
    "independence. <font color='blue'> It is, however, the intensity of our desire that counts for most. </font> \"I desire to\n",
    "become a good public speaker,\" says one. \"How strong is your desire?\" asks the teacher. \"Will\n",
    "you practice regularly every day for an hour?!\" \"I don't think I can,\" says the student, \"because\n",
    "my time is so much occupied during the day, and at night I am too tired.\" \"What personal\n",
    "sacrifices are you ready to make?\" \"None,\" is the answer. \"Then,\" replies the teacher, \"your\n",
    "desire is not strong enough to make you a good public speaker.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This applies with equal force to you who read these pages in search of help to develop your\n",
    "self-confidence. <font color='blue'> How strong is your desire to acquire this great power? </font> Is it strong enough to\n",
    "lead you carefully to read all the suggestions offered here and to put them into actual practice?\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> Will you enter upon this study with intense earnestness and perseverance? Will you make\n",
    "reasonable sacrifice to achieve this great end? Your answer to such questions as these will\n",
    "largely determine what your success will be. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> In the life of every man there are many times when he is in an exalted frame of mind. There is a\n",
    "sudden realization of new and mysterious power, when, indeed, all things seem possible to him. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> He there upon resolves to do better and greater things than ever before, but in a little while this\n",
    "feeling dies away, leaving only the slightest impress behind it. </font> The student bent upon\n",
    "educating his will <font color='blue'> should resolve in his mind to take advantage of these favorable moments to\n",
    "fortify such thoughts with other favorable thoughts, to bring instantly to bear upon himself\n",
    "every conception and emotion that will deepen this sudden inspiration, and to proceed without\n",
    "delay to put these results into actual practice. \"Seize the very first possible opportunity,\" </font>\n",
    "advises \"William James, \"to act on every resolution you make and on every emotional\n",
    "prompting you may experience in the direction of the habits you aspire to gain.<font color='blue'> \"To choose intelligently between our complex and conflicting desires we must avoid\n",
    "impulsiveness. </font> <font color='blue'> In every important matter we shall weigh things pro and con, and carefully\n",
    "consider the advantages, dangers, and probabilities before determining our course of action. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "This will teach us caution and self-restraint. We are told to \"look before we leap,\" to \"think\n",
    "twice,\" and again that \"haste makes waste.\" <font color='blue'> A little more prudence and deliberateness would\n",
    "prevent most of the serious mistakes of life. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> Sometimes an idea must be repeated many times before an enduring impression can be made\n",
    "upon the mind. This is illustrated in modern methods of advertising. </font> The first time you see an\n",
    "announcement it impresses you perhaps feebly. But it is repeated again and again, in\n",
    "newspaper, magazine, letter, and fence-poster, until at length a sufficient number of\n",
    "impressions lead you to become a purchaser. <font color='blue'> Mental habits are established in the same way. A\n",
    "suggestion is made to your mind once, twice, a hundred, or a thousand times. Some day this\n",
    "repeated suggestion has become a fixed habit, and fulfils its duty unconsciously. The power of\n",
    "reiteration is so great that, if a timid man were to repeat aloud for a few minutes daily, with\n",
    "earnestness and concentration, a list of words such as courage, valor, bravery, gallantry,\n",
    "intrepidity, manliness, pluck, backbone, and audacity, he would shortly find these qualities\n",
    "being incorporated in his own personality. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> We must be particularly careful about outside influences. </font> A certain course of conduct is\n",
    "decided upon, after mature consideration, when suddenly we yield to the interposition of a\n",
    "friend who advises an altogether different course. Then when it terminates disastrously, we\n",
    "blame our friend for his interference, and our self for weakness of will. <font color='blue'> There are times, of\n",
    "course, when the advice of others should be sought and considered, but once having\n",
    "determined what our conduct shall be, let us pursue it without hesitation. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> We should be as frank with ourselves as we are with others. We are not slow to point out to\n",
    "them the dangers that lie in a certain course. We can quite as earnestly advise, caution, and\n",
    "urge ourselves in what is best to do. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> A realization of personal responsibility has an important influence upon the building of the will. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> We owe it to our manhood, to others dependent upon us, and to our eternal destiny, that we\n",
    "make the most of ourselves here and now. Our will, no less than our other powers, is given to\n",
    "us for intelligent development. </font> As we more clearly realize this responsibility we shall see the\n",
    "vital importance of willpower and make an increasing effort to build it for high and definite\n",
    "ends. \"The education of the will,\" says Dr. Morell, \"is really of far greater importance, as\n",
    "shaping the destiny of the individual, than that of the intellect; and it should never be lost sight\n",
    "of by the practical educator, that <font color='blue'> it is only by the amassing and consolidating of our volitional\n",
    "residua in certain given directions that this end can be secured. </font> <font color='blue'> Theory and doctrine, and\n",
    "inculcation of laws and propositions, will never of themselves lead to the uniform habit of right\n",
    "action. It is by doing that we learn to do; by overcoming, that we learn to overcome; by\n",
    "obeying reason and conscience, that we learn to obey; </font> and every right act which we cause to\n",
    "spring out of pure principles, whether by authority, precept, or example, will have a greater\n",
    "weight in the formation of character than all the theory in the world.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> The fatal habit of procrastination should be fought persistently. To do things promptly, clearly,\n",
    "and systematically, will insure peace of mind and pleasure in one's work. </font> A business man upon\n",
    "being asked how he managed to attend to so many intricate details of his daily business with\n",
    "apparently no care or worry, said it was due to an invariable rule to clear off his desk by the\n",
    "close of the day in order to begin the following day clear and fresh. This same plan can be\n",
    "advantageously followed in the ordering of one's mind. <font color='blue'> Instead of permitting ideas and plans tolie about the mind in confusion, like scattered papers on an untidy desk, they should be\n",
    "classified, \"pigeon-holed,\" and put into their proper places. Then a man can take a problem at a\n",
    "time; give it due consideration, and dispose of it in satisfactory and orderly fashion. This\n",
    "actually doing things gradually strengthens the will and at length renders it capable of great\n",
    "achievement. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> To begin is often half the battle. </font> \"I shall start to-morrow,\" pleads the indolent man, forgetting\n",
    "that \"to-morrow\" never comes. \"Next winter I shall study\n",
    "\n",
    "French, drawing, shorthand, or public speaking,\" says another man of good intention. But the\n",
    "season comes and goes, and at the close he finds he has not done one of these things.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> Procrastination, love of ease or amusement, indefiniteness, imprudence, or miscalculation, have\n",
    "conspired against him, so a whole lifetime may be frittered away in needless and unproductive\n",
    "occupations, due not to lack of ability but to weakness of will. </font> Goethe sings:\n",
    "\"Are you in earnest? Seize this very minute. Whatever you can do, or dream you can begin it.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> It is surprising how difficulty yields before a strong and earnest will. A little more resolution\n",
    "and effort, a determination \"to do or die,\" and the seemingly impossible is accomplished. </font> This\n",
    "has been remarkably illustrated in the achievements of men of advanced age. <font color='blue'> Cato learned\n",
    "\n",
    "Greek, Plutarch studied Latin, and Socrates music, in old age. </font> Gladstone became again\n",
    "\n",
    "Premier of England at eighty-three, and spoke with great eloquence, while Tennyson at the\n",
    "same age wrote his imperishable hymn, \"Crossing the Bar.\" <font color='blue'> A record of the great things done\n",
    "by men between the ages of seventy and ninety, chiefly through indomitable willpower, </font> would\n",
    "include such names as Michelangelo, Goethe, Titian, Wesley, Kant, Von Moltke, Spencer,\n",
    "\n",
    "Jefferson, Browning, Clay, Calhoun, and Bismarck.\n",
    "\"Where there is a will there is a way,\" is still true, and if a man draws upon the infinite\n",
    "resources within him he may exclaim with Napoleon, \"There shall be no Alps.\" <font color='blue'> No man should\n",
    "allow temporary failure to disarm or discourage him. A too easy success would hardly be\n",
    "worth the winning. </font> <font color='blue'> It is the realization of difficulties overcome, of opposition conquered, and\n",
    "of great heights scaled that bring satisfaction to the mind and joy to the heart of the victor. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "In his suggestive essay on \"Self-Culture,\" Channing reminds us that <font color='blue'> \"A vigorous purpose\n",
    "makes much out of little, breathes power into weak instruments, disarms difficulties, and even\n",
    "turns them into assistances.\" A man who firmly says \"I will,\" is already on the way. But he\n",
    "must not suffer himself to be lured away into by-paths. Once the goal is fixed before him, let\n",
    "him walk unswervingly toward it. </font> Dr. Jules Payot, in his inspiring work on <font color='blue'> \"The Education of\n",
    "the Will,\" says:\n",
    "\"When a young man has formed this very important and productive habit of deciding things\n",
    "definitely and of doing his work without feverish haste, but in a thorough, straightforward and\n",
    "honest manner, there is no high intellectual destiny to which he may not aspire. </font> Whether he has\n",
    "new ideas or whether he sees old questions from a new point of view, he is going to harbor\n",

    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> Daily speech offers one of the vast opportunities for eliminating self-consciousness. </font> The\n",
    "student should aim here to develop definiteness of idea, sincerity of expression, and\n",
    "concentration of mind. <font color='blue'> Nothing leads so quickly to hesitation and embarrassment in a speaker\n",
    "as mental uncertainty. To speak confidently, he must not guess, or imagine, or take for\n",
    "granted: he must know. </font> Lack of proper mental equipment is responsible for a large part of the\n",
    "fearfulness of men. <font color='blue'> One who really knows whereof he speaks, and is absolutely sure of it, is\n",
    "likely to be sure of himself. It manifests itself in his voice, his use of words, his manner, and his\n",
    "entire personality. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> The speaker should cultivate sincerity in his conversation. He will avoid formal compliments\n",
    "and empty platitudes. </font> He will not talk like a book. He will not talk for talking's sake. <font color='blue'> He will\n",
    "speak for a purpose, and this will enable him easily to concentrate his mind upon the subject of\n",
    "his conversation. He will listen attentively and interestedly to others. Above all, he will not\n",
    "speak of himself unless obliged to do so, and then briefly, modestly, and gently. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "In what manner, then, shall he speak\" Newman's definition of a gentleman here rings in our\n",
    "ears: '' <font color='blue'> He guards against unseasonable allusions or topics which may irritate; he is seldom\n",
    "prominent in conversation, and never wearisome. He makes light of favors when he does them,\n",
    "and seems to be receiving when he is conferring. He never speaks of himself except when\n",
    "compelled, never defends himself by a mere retort; he has no ears for slander or gossip, is\n",
    "scrupulous in imputing motives to those who interfere with him, and interprets everything for\n",
    "the best.\" </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> This self-discipline begins naturally with deep breathing. </font> Many men do not realize that the\n",
    "manner in which they breathe affects their attitude of mind. It is altogether too common to use\n",
    "but one half of the breathing capacity. <font color='blue'> A man who breathes only with his upper chest is without\n",
    "the vigor and vitality essential to a high degree of self-confidence. Deep breathing should be\n",
    "practiced daily until it becomes an unconscious habit. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> What is the remedy for this dreaded self-consciousness? It is mainly a matter of securing\n",
    "control of one's thoughts and intelligently directing them. The mind is a machine, </font> which must\n",
    "be made obedient to the owner's will. <font color='blue'> When brought under subjection, it will serve man's\n",
    "highest and best purposes, but left to itself it may run easily to confusion and destruction. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you perhaps interpose: <font color='blue'> \"But my mind wanders.\" Then go after it and bring it back. </font> You\n",
    "say you can not? Who is operating your mind? Does it run itself? What would you think of a\n",
    "train that had no engineer, no conductor, no one to direct it, and was allowed to run\n",
    "anywhere? Yet this is what you permit with your train of ideas. <font color='blue'> Be sensible. Take hold of\n",
    "yourself seriously. Set your will to work. </font> Straighten your spine. Take time to-day for mental\n",
    "overhauling. You are about to educate your will and it is serious business. Procrastination will\n",
    "not do. <font color='blue'> From this time forward resolve to control and direct your mental powers for definite\n",
    "purposes. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> Let it be said here, without attempt to moralize, that wrongdoing will contribute its share to\n",
    "self-consciousness. </font> It may be an injury done another, an unfair advantage in business, or a\n",
    "secret habit; but whatever it be, <font color='blue'> its mark is seared upon the conscience, and sooner or later\n",
    "finds expression in embarrassment. </font> What should one do who comes under this classification?\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> Repair the injury, stop every undesirable habit, and resolve hereafter to deal justly with all men. </font> \n",
    "<font color='blue'> Constantly hold in your mind a high estimate of yourself, but be sure you have reasons for\n",
    "doing so. </font> It is of little use to say you are well if you are ill. <font color='blue'> Do not deceive yourself. You are\n",
    "no greater than the sum of your thoughts and habits. Have you good and sufficient reasons for\n",
    "your self-approbation. </font> Are you a man of noble impulses? Is your ambition lofty? Have you\n",
    "high ideals and do you work persistently to realize them? Are you doing the best you can?\n",
    "Have you an uncompromising love for truth?\n",
    "\n",
    "A business man recently wrote to a teacher, saying: \"I lose control and become embarrassed\n",
    "when I speak even to my own employees, and can not keep a straight face at any time when\n",
    "meeting strangers. I feel embarrassed, turn red in the face, and otherwise feel uncomfortable\n",
    "when talking to a single individual. If I were called upon to address an audience, I believe I\n",
    "should drop dead.\" This is an illustration of the extremes to which self-consciousness may\n",
    "carry its victim. <font color='blue'> The mind is a prolific field for the growth of all kinds of thought. If false and\n",
    "negative ideas are allowed to take root, they, like weeds of an ordinary field, spread with\n",
    "wonderful rapidity, and may easily discourage and overwhelm the owner. </font> The man to whom\n",
    "we have referred has long neglected his mental field and now finds himself in a bad way. <font color='blue'> The\n",
    "remedy for him, and for others so situated, is patiently to root out every obnoxious habit and\n",
    "to substitute strong, healthy, positive thoughts in its place. He must at first be content with\n",
    "small victories, since he has permitted his mental field and garden to be overrun with these\n",
    "objectionable thought habits, but he can comfort himself with the assurance that in this way he\n",
    "can and will attain success. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> Timid people concern themselves too much about what others will think and say. They are\n",
    "constantly studying the impression they are making upon people who probably are not even\n",
    "thinking of them. Their super sensitiveness causes them to imagine themselves being criticized,\n",
    "slighted, and unfairly condemned by those who all the while are absorbed in their own affairs. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> A man may be on the road to success when a single act of timidity may annul all his chances. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> People lose confidence in him if he lacks faith in himself. Courage is admired, fear never is. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> Courage is dignified, fear is repulsive. The man of courage is welcomed everywhere, while fear\n",
    "invites itself to a seat in the rear. </font> The following incident actually occurred in a second-hand\n",
    "bookshop. The salesman had been talking for some time to a customer, when another man who\n",
    "had selected a book for himself mustered up enough courage to say: \"Don't let me interrupt\n",
    "you, sir, if you are busy with that gentleman I wanted to get this book--but I can just as\n",
    "well call in on my way back--I would have to trouble you anyway--to change--a five-dollar\n",
    "bill--and perhaps--you haven't--the change-so I'll come back--in a little while--don't trouble,\n",
    "sir--and then I'll have the right change with me.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This sounds exaggerated, but it can be vouched for. What chance, think you, has such a man as\n",
    "that for advancement or distinction in the world? He is foredoomed to failure unless he\n",
    "changes his entire mental attitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> Every man should learn to stand firmly upon his own feet. As himself he may become great; as\n",
    "an imitator he will amount to little. </font> \"Intellectual intrepidity,\" says Samuel Smiles \"is one of the\n",
    "vital conditions of independence and self-reliance in character. <font color='blue'> A man must have the courage\n",
    "to be himself, and not the shadow or the echo of another. He must exercise his own powers,\n",
    "think his own thoughts, and speak his own sentiments. He must elaborate his own opinions,\n",
    "and form his own convictions. It has been said that he who dare not form an opinion must be a\n",
    "coward; he who will not, must be an idler; he who can not, must be a fool.\" </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> The timid man should take inspiration from the experience of many of the world's greatest\n",
    "orators and actors. For the most part they at first were self-conscious men. </font> Demosthenes,\n",
    "\n",
    "Cicero, Curran, Chalmers, Erskine, Pitt, Gladstone, Disraeli, Mirabeau, Patrick Henry, Clay,\n",
    "\n",
    "Gough, Beecher, Salvini, Henry Irving, Richard Mansfield, and many others were subject to\n",
    "<font color='blue'> \"stage-fright.\" But this sensitiveness of nature, when at last controlled and intelligently\n",
    "directed, enabled them to reach a foremost place among distinguished men. </font> It is said of Rufus\n",
    "\n",
    "Choate, the great lawyer, that before an important address to a jury he looked as nervous and\n",
    "wretched as a criminal about to be hanged. Probably every public speaker who has amounted\n",
    "to anything could testify to this <font color='blue'> initial feeling of nervousness or anxiety, but the cure lies in\n",
    "becoming so absorbed in one's subject, or the welfare of others, as to forget one's self. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> Self-consciousness may arise from self conceit. The victim says to himself: </font> \"What impression\n",
    "am I making?\" \"Do I look well?\" \"What are they thinking and saying about me?\" <font color='blue'> On the other\n",
    "hand, it may be due to extreme humility. Such a man says inwardly: </font> \"I am not equal to this,\" \"I\n",
    "lack so many things,\" \"If I had only been born right,\" \"My father was bashful before me,\" \"I\n",
    "shall surely fail.\" <font color='blue'> Natural diffidence need not necessarily be a stumbling-block to any man. It is\n",
    "a safeguard against rashness, familiarity, and over-confidence. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> The evil of extreme self-consciousness is that it makes a man do so many things he does not\n",
    "wish to do. It changes his line of conduct a hundred times a day, makes him say \"yes\" when he\n",
    "would rather say \"no,\" and, in short, robs him of his power and individuality. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> When Thackeray said that sensitiveness was a great mistake in a public man, he doubtless\n",
    "meant that super sensitiveness by which a man loses initiative, self-reliance, and independence. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> A self-conscious man must sooner or later rid himself of this fault if he is to be preeminently\n",
    "successful. </font> To this end the student's attention is next directed to the power of right thinking."

    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'>We should not apologize to ourselves. A sense of the dignity of life, and the sovereignty of the\n",
    "soul, should keep us strong and positive. We should be too big for the little habit of\n",
    "excuse-making. Self-depreciation never won a single battle of life. It has, on the contrary,\n",
    "killed ambition, weakened the will, and incapacitated thousands of men for noble work.\n",
    "Apology is weakness on parade. Avoid it.</font> Observe some man who comes toward you,\n",
    "walking with short, jerky steps, his dress careless, the corners of his mouth turned down,\n",
    "keeping well to one side of the walk. As he passes, he gives you a hasty, frightened glance,\n",
    "which tells you unmistakably of despair, discouragement, and failure. The man's whole life\n",
    "probably has been negative in its character and outlook. The daily, and perhaps hourly, streams\n",
    "of false suggestions poured into his mind have at last overwhelmed him and his life closes in an\n",
    "eclipse.\n",
    "<font color='blue'>Many a man tormented by fear and timidity does not realize what a flood of negative thoughts\n",
    "daily affects him. He hedges himself in with suggestions of limitation, incapacity, and\n",
    "unworthiness. He constantly thinks not of how he will succeed, but of how he will surely fail.</font>\n",
    "When Washington Irving was asked to preside at a public dinner to Charles Dickens, upon his\n",
    "visit to America, he hesitated and said he would surely fail. It was pointed out to him that he\n",
    "was really the man properly to direct that high function, and at last was prevailed upon to\n",
    "accept. But to many friends he repeated his fear that he would fail. The night came, and before\n",
    "a brilliant gathering Irving arose to speak. He made an excellent beginning, but suddenly\n",
    "stopped and brought his remarks to a close. As he sat down, he whispered to a friend on his\n",
    "left, \"There, I told you I would fail, and I did!\"\n",
    "<font color='blue'>In developing the habit of positive thinking--of seeing only the best in yourself and others--of\n",
    "regarding yourself as capable of great things--it is well to bear in mind that our thoughts really\n",
    "make us what we are. What you did yesterday makes you what you are to-day, and what you\n",
    "do to-day determines what you will be tomorrow.</font> Suppose you put these practical questions to\n",
    "yourself: Does negative thinking pay? Is it desirable for me to encourage thoughts in my mind\n",
    "that break down, hinder, and incapacitate me for good work? Do I want negative thoughts that\n",
    "inevitably bring discontent, unhappiness, and ultimate failure in their train?\n",
    "Your answer will be, of course, that you do not want them. But such thoughts work\n",
    "insidiously, and will find an entrance into your mind if you are not extremely vigilant. <font color='blue'>The\n",
    "surest way to keep them out, however, is to fill the mind completely with vital positive\n",
    "thoughts, to think constantly of yourself as a man of unlimited possibilities, growing daily in\n",
    "mental and spiritual power, equipped for great things, a necessary part of God's glorious\n",
    "creation, and moving forward toward a triumphant and immortal destiny.</font>\n",
    "It is difficult to construct positive thoughts out of the poor stuff from which dreams are made.\n",
    "<font color='blue'>A man should devote himself particularly to the practical things of life. Some men learn this\n",
    "lesson all too late,</font> for, as Thoreau says, '' Youth gets together the materials for a bridge to the\n",

    "<font color='blue'>The habit of right thinking, when firmly established, becomes a source of attraction.</font> Good\n",
    "thoughts soon become great thoughts, and the mature mind attempts even the impossible. <font color='blue'>The\n",
    "power of a single thought at the beginning of a day can hardly be estimated. It can change\n",
    "despondency into hope, and fear into courage. It can nerve the arm for great and noble deeds.It can strengthen a weak and timid character into four-fourths of a man. It is possible for it to\n",
    "set in motion an influence that will reach the ends of the world.\n",
    "The importance of right thinking is its effect upon right doing.</font> How many disastrous mistakes\n",
    "are made for lack of proper thought? How many of life's failures are due to a careless and\n",
    "unwise selection of a business or profession? It was Sidney\n",
    "Smith who said: \"If we represent the occupations of life by holes in a table, some round, some\n",
    "square, some oblong, and persons by bits of wood of like shapes, we shall generally find that\n",
    "the triangular person has got into the square hole, the oblong into the triangular, while the\n",
    "square person has squeezed himself into the round hole.\"\n",
    "<font color='blue'>But meditation, too, is an essential part of clear and right thinking.</font> A writer said that there is\n",
    "not much real, honest thinking done in the world, but we are not inclined to agree with him.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'>Much of the thinking is honest enough, but it is badly organized, and even more badly applied.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'>We must learn to brood more over our thoughts, to dwell long and intently upon ideas that\n",
    "seem dark and obscure, to fashion patiently intricate links of truth into chains of powerful\n",
    "argument.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'>In his pursuit of right thinking the student should learn the art of definition. Thoughts fully\n",
    "matured in the mind are seen to be there in so many words.</font> What do our thoughts or words\n",
    "really mean? <font color='blue'>The first step is to define them, and next to consider their truth.</font> <font color='blue'>The habit of\n",
    "constant and searching reflection,\"</font> recommended by Gladstone, <font color='blue'>is what more than anything\n",
    "else produces right thinking.</font>\n",

    "character not possessed before. They can then better be considered, analyzed, and assigned to\n",
    "their proper duty or thrown upon the scrap-heap. The very act of giving expression to our\n",
    "thoughts illuminates and invests them with new power and significance.</font>\n",
    "<font color='blue'>An excellent way to furnish the mind with material for right thinking is to commit to memory\n",
    "some of the sayings of great men and to ponder them at leisure.</font>\n",

    "SOURCES OP INSPIRATION\n",
    "The masterful thoughts of great minds are ours for the asking. A mans intent upon developing\n",
    "his self-confidence will read the biographies of such men as Caesar, Napoleon, Wellington,\n",
    "Milton, Goethe, Macaulay, Mozart, Wilberforce, Tennyson, Ruskin, Washington, Franklin,\n",
    "Webster, Lincoln, and Phillips Brooks. It develops a man's self-confidence to study biography\n",
    "and to know what other men have done in the face of difficulty and discouragement. When he\n",
    "reads what they have done, he has a burning desire to go and do likewise. Just as \"we\n",
    "recognize in a work of genius our own rejected thoughts,\" so we often see ourselves in the\n",
    "pages of a great book. Who could fail to be inspired by such a description of unaffected\n",
    "self-confidence as this of Washington:\n",
    "\"No nobler figure ever stood in the forefront of a nation's life. Washington was grave and\n",
    "courteous in address: his manners were simple and unpretentious; his silence and the serene\n",
    "calmness of his temper spoke of a perfect self-mastery; but there was little in his outer bearing\n",
    "to reveal the grandeur of soul which lifts his figure, with all the simple majesty of an ancient\n",
    "statue, out of the smaller passions, the meaner impulses of the world around him. ... It was\n",
    "only as the weary fight went on that the colonists learned little by little the greatness of their\n",
    "leader--his clear judgment, his heroic endurance, his silence under difficulties, his calmness in\n",
    "the hour of danger or defeat, the patience with which he waited, the quickness and hardness\n",
    "with which he struck, the lofty and serene sense of duty that never swerved from its task\n",
    "through resentment or jealousy, that never through war or peace felt the touch of a mean\n",
    "ambition, that knew no aim save that of guarding the freedom of his fellow countrymen, and no\n",
    "personal longing save that of returning to his own fireside when their freedom was secured.\"\n",
    "It was Correggio who, after looking at the work of Michelangelo, exclaimed, \"And I, too, am a\n",
    "painter!\" By closely observing the lives of great men, we assume some of their great qualities.\n",
    "They embody the wisdom of their time, and pass it on to us as our heritage. \"I am a part of\n",
    "every man I have met,\" said a sympathetic writer, and one might as truthfully say, \"I am part of\n",
    "all I have read.'' Channing well says:\n",
    "\"It is chiefly through books that we enjoy intercourse with superior minds, and these invaluable\n",
    "means of communication are in the reach of all. In the best books great men talk to us, give us\n",
    "their most precious thoughts, and pour their souls into ours. God be thanked for books. They\n",
    "are the voices of the distant and the dead, and make us heirs of the spiritual life of past ages.\n",
    "Books are the true levelers. They give to all who will faithfully use them the society, the\n",
    "spiritual presence, of the best and greatest of our race. No matter how poor I am, no matter\n",
    "though the prosperous of my own time will not enter my obscure dwelling. If the sacred\n",
    "writers will enter and take up their abode under my roof; if Milton will cross my threshold to\n",
    "sing to me of Paradise, and Shakespeare to open to me the worlds of imagination and the\n",
    "workings of the human heart, and Franklin to enrich me with his practical wisdom, I shall not\n",
    "pine for want of intellectual companionship, and I may become a cultivated man though\n",
    "excluded from what is called the best society in the place where I live.\" The student of\n",
    "self-confidence should choose his books as carefully as he does his personal friends. Books are\n",
    "our intimate companions, with the unusual privilege of setting them down or taking them up at\n",
    "will. It is not worth while to spend any time over a book that does not cause the reader to raise\n",
    "from it a better man. \"Youth is a prophesy, and old age a history, '' but great books never\n",
    "grow old and are ours to command and serve at will.What, then, shall a man read? First and supreme over all other books, the Bible. Here is\n",
    "history, biography, poetry, drama, and every form of literary art in its highest perfection.\n",
    "Where else will you find sublimity of thought embodied in such simplicity of language as this:\n",
    "\"And God said let there be light, and there was light!\" Dr. Hillis says: \"Bead all other books,\n",
    "philosophy, poetry, history, fiction; but if you would refine the judgment, fertilize the reason,\n",
    "wing the imagination, attain unto the finest womanhood or the sturdiest manhood, read this\n",
    "Book, reverently and prayerfully, until its truths have dissolved like iron into the blood.\"\n",
    "The student of public speaking will read Quintilian's \"Institutes of Oratory, or the Education of\n",
    "an Orator,\" supplementing it with Cicero on \"Oratory and Orators,\" and Cicero's \"Orations.\"\n",
    "For self-culture he will read Plato's \"Republic,\" and the \"Dialogues\" relating to Socrates.\n",
    "Demosthenes \"On the Crown,\" the greatest world's oration by the greatest of all orators,\n",
    "should receive special attention. Shakespeare, Milton, Dante,\n",
    "Wordsworth, Tennyson, and Longfellow will have a prominent place upon the wise man's\n",
    "book-shelf. To shape his mind to strong and logical thinking, he will studiously read Locke\n",
    "\"On the Conduct of the Understanding,\" Berkeley's \"Principles of Human Knowledge,\"\n",
    "Leibnitz's \"Discourse on Metaphysics,\" Descartes' \"Discourse on Method,\" and Lotze's \"\n",
    "Microcosmus.\"\n",
    "The student of self-confidence will read stories of heroism and self-sacrifice. Scott's novels,\n",
    "and Stevenson's stirring stories of the sea, will arouse in him a desire to play a noble part in the\n",
    "drama of life. He should read only those books that move his finest impulses, fire his blood,\n",
    "and equip him for better and larger service.\n",
    "Many men are not sufficiently familiar with the great books of the world to choose for\n",
    "themselves. For their benefit the following suggestive list is offered:\n",
    "Great Dramatists: Job, AEschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, Shakespeare, Moliere,\n",
    "Goethe, Sheridan, Schiller.\n",
    "Great Essayists: Montaigne, Addison, Lamb, De Quincey, Carlyle, Macaulay, Newman,\n",
    "Emerson, Ruskin, Matthew Arnold.\n",
    "Great Philosophers: Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Descartes, Spinoza, Leibnitz, Berkeley, Kant,\n",
    "Schopenhauer, Lotze.\n",
    "Great Scientists: Galileo, Herschel, Newton, Agassiz, La Place, Darwin, Tyndall, Helmholtz,\n",
    "Huxley.\n",
    "Great Lawyers: Demosthenes, Cicero, Blackstone, Erskine, Marshall, Mackintosh, Clay,\n",
    "Webster, Prentiss, Jeremiah Black.\n",
    "Great Teachers: Quintilian, Aquinas, Erasmus, Bacon, Locke, Herbart, Frobel, Spencer.\n",
    "Great Logicians and Political Economists : Montesquieu, Adam Smith, Bentham, Malthus,\n",
    "Hegel, Whateley, Hamilton, Mill, Jevons.\n",
    "Great Statesmen: Pericles, Cassar, Burke, Washington, Jefferson, Bonaparte, Disraeli,\n",
    "Lincoln, Gladstone, Bismarck.\n",
    "Great Theologians: Saint Paul, Saint Augustine, Luther, Calvin, Hooker, Edwards,Schleiermacher, Bushnell.\n",
    "Great Historians: Herodotus, Thucydides, Livy, Polybius, Plutarch, Tacitus, Gibbon,\n",
    "Macaulay, Carlyle, Grote, Bancroft, Mommsen.\n",
    "The advantages of judicious reading are many. Not only is the mind stored with precious\n",
    "thoughts and the imagination filled with exquisite pictures, but unconsciously a free and\n",
    "melodious English style is acquired. There should be daily reading aloud. It is of distinct\n",
    "advantage to learn the author's words through the additional sense of hearing. It makes them\n",
    "more enduring, and the very act of expressing them aloud will often cause the reader very\n",
    "particularly to bring their meaning into full view. Reading aloud should be more widely\n",
    "cultivated than it is. There is a charm in the spoken word that is not found in the cold printed\n",
    "page. Speech invests a writer's words with new life and bids them live again. These great\n",
    "treasures, gathered up in the books of the world, mean much to men who know how to claim\n",
    "and use them. \"In books,\" writes Carlyle, \"is the soul of the whole past time--the articulate\n",
    "audible voice of the past, when the body and material substance of it has altogether vanished\n",
    "like a dream. Mighty fleets and armies, harbors and arsenals, vast cities, high-domed, many\n",
    "engined they are precious, great; but what do they become? Agamemnon, the many\n",
    "Agamemnon s, and their Greece--all is gone now to some ruined fragments, dumb, mournful\n",
    "wrecks and blocks; but the books--_i.e., _the thoughts--of Greece! There Greece, to every\n",
    "thinker, still very literally lives--can be called up again into life! No magic Rome is stronger\n",
    "than a book--a thought, or collection of thoughts. All that mankind has done, thought, gained,\n",
    "or been, it is lying as in a magic preservation in the pages of books. They are the chosen\n",
    "possession of men.\"\n",
    "A source of inspiration to one who would cultivate self-confidence is that of mingling with\n",
    "self-confident men. We grow to be like those with whom we associate. Human society is the\n",
    "great leveler, taking man out of himself, and teaching him the power of sympathy and\n",
    "unselfishness. Man was not made to live alone, and it is only in some form of service to others\n",
    "that he attains unto the truest greatness.\n",
    "Beecher called the study of man the highest of sciences, and his own marvelous wealth of\n",
    "illustrations and anecdotes was due largely to his habit of keeping close to the people. \"I take\n",
    "great delight,\" said he, \"if ever I get a chance, in riding on the top of an omnibus with the\n",
    "driver, and talking with him. What do I gain by that? Why, my sympathy goes out for these\n",
    "men, and I recognize in them an element of brotherhood--that great human element which lies\n",
    "underneath all culture, which is more universal and more important than all special attributes,\n",
    "which is the great generic bond of humanity between man and man. If ever I saw one of these\n",
    "men in my Church, I could preach to him, and hit him under the fifth rib with an illustration,\n",
    "much better than if I had not been acquainted with him.\"\n",
    "The blush-persecuted, timid man is usually found to have lived too much by himself. He has\n",
    "had too much time for introspection. The result is that when he steps out into society he is ill at\n",
    "ease, and its very strangeness causes him embarrassment. Such men very often act awkwardly\n",
    "and unnaturally, not for lack of knowledge, but for lack of familiarity and practice. A\n",
    "gathering of people confuses him, and at the first opportunity he seeks refuge in solitude. Such\n",
    "men, diffident, self-conscious men, should force themselves out into the common society of\n",
    "others where they may learn some of the most inspiring lessons of life.\n",
    "When you rise from reading a great book that has inspired you to better and greater things,\n",
    "then is the time to set down in writing your new-made resolutions and to put at least some'part of them into immediate practice. Perhaps you have decided to seek a higher place among\n",
    "your fellow men? Then go out among them, prepared to render service. Be interested in their\n",
    "welfare, and give to them freely of your sympathy and cheerfulness. Cultivate a true-hearted\n",
    "and intelligent optimism toward everyone. Carry in your voice and manner a message of hope\n",
    "and good will, and give what you can without thought of receiving.\n",
    "Possibly you have determined to employ your time to better advantage. Begin, then, to do so\n",
    "to-day. Have a definite program. Be economical of the little spare moments that are so easily\n",
    "frittered away. When a thing is to be done, do not merely survey it, or worry about it, but\n",
    "begin it at once and keep at it until it is done. If you are interrupted, excuse yourself as soon as\n",
    "possible, and apply your time and energies with increased diligence. Work daily toward larger\n",
    "and more important things. Think of nothing as being too high or too great for your ambition.\n",
    "Resolve to waste no time. Outside of your regular calling, devote yourself earnestly to studies\n",
    "and recreations that up build, strengthen, and fit you for larger pursuits.\n",
    "Perhaps you have resolved to develop more courage and independence. Stand up at once, lift\n",
    "your chest high and full into the attitude of the man you would be. Look the next person you\n",
    "meet straight in the eyes, and as you talk to him put earnestness and conviction into every\n",
    "word you utter. Think of yourself as a strong, energetic, cheerful, positive character, while all\n",

    "CONCENTRATION\n",
    "Distinguished men have invariably had great concentration. In art and science, business and\n",
    "warfare, literature, politics and philosophy, the real achievements of the race have been due to\n",
    "this power. Concentration arises chiefly from being deeply interested, and is allied to\n",
    "persistency and definiteness of purpose. It is an enemy to self-consciousness and vacillation. It\n",
    "enables a man to do the best that is in him. It is a characteristic mark of genius itself.\n",
    "A timid man is fitful in his habits. He shifts constantly from one thing to another, accomplishing\n",
    "nothing worthy of the name. Is it a book he is reading? Soon he turns the pages impatiently,\n",
    "skims lightly over the most important parts, hastens to learn the conclusion, and casts the book\n",
    "aside. Is it a new business venture? He enters upon it enthusiastically, but at the first sign of\n",
    "difficulty loses heart and gives up. Every change he makes entails a loss of time and energy, so\n",
    "that he is always going but never arriving.\n",
    "A man makes his own thought world. To cultivate attention he must think and do only one\n",
    "thing at a time. Concentration is the faculty of continuous and intense application. It is not\n",
    "abstraction; hence it can not be offered as an excuse for carelessness. A young man in one of\n",
    "our banks took out for collection a note for $75,000. He received the customer's check for the\n",
    "amount, had it certified, and returned to the bank. The cashier immediately engaged him in\n",
    "conversation, and sent him out again. He loitered on the way, and when he returned the bank\n",
    "had closed and the cashier had gone home. That night the young man told his father how he\n",
    "came to have the check still in his pocket. His father made him telephone to the president and\n",
    "the cashier of the bank, and early next morning the young man handed in the check. The\n",
    "president called him into his office and said: \"We do not require your services further.\"\n",
    "Thoroughness is one of the marks of a self-confident man. He does everything he undertakes\n",
    "just as well as he can. If it is a business matter to be discussed, he first informs himself so\n",
    "completely that he is able to talk with accuracy and intelligence. If it is a public speech to be\n",
    "delivered, he does not wait until the day before and then put together a few hastily considered\n",
    "thoughts, but all is carefully and thoroughly prepared long in advance. Such a man speaks little\n",
    "of what he is going to do, but first does it and lets his work speak for itself.\n",
    "Every man should get a right idea of values. There can be no true culture where time and talent\n",
    "are squandered. \"Every moment lost,\" said Napoleon, himself a wonderful example of\n",
    "concentration, \"gives an opportunity for misfortune.\" The building of a self-confident man\n",
    "requires effort, self-sacrifice, and singleness of purpose.\n",
    "It is not quantity but quality of work that differentiates one man from another. One thing well\n",
    "and thoroughly done is better than any amount of slipshod work. The man who is completely\n",
    "absorbed in the present duty has no time for discontent and discouragement. Time does not\n",
    "hang heavily on his hands, for the clock is not his master.\n",
    "No one can become deeply interested in work that is distasteful to him. Thousands of men\n",
    "struggle up-stream all their lives because they are in their wrong calling. An anonymous writer\n",
    "well says: \"It is a sad parody on life to see a man earning his living by a vocation which has\n",
    "never received his approval. It is pitiable to see a youth, with the image of power and destiny\n",
    "stamped upon him, trying to support himself in a mean, contemptible occupation, which dwarfs\n",
    "his nature, and makes him despise himself; an occupation which is constantly condemning him,ostracizing him from all that is best and truest in life. Dig trenches, shovel coal, carry a rod; do\n",
    "anything rather than sacrifice your self-respect, blunt your sense of right and wrong, and shut\n",
    "yourself off forever from the true joy of living, which comes only from the consciousness of\n",
    "doing one's best.\"\n",
    "In order to cultivate concentration a man must bring his will to bear strongly upon his work\n",
    "and life. He should realize that every difficulty yields to this power, and that uninterrupted\n",
    "application to one thing will achieve the seemingly impossible. Mental shiftlessness is\n",
    "powerless in the face of difficulty, but a man of strong will and concentration uses obstacles as\n",
    "stepping-stones to higher things.\n",
    "Let the student begin to develop his concentration to-day in little things. Let him cultivate the\n",
    "most intense earnestness in whatever he may be doing. Let him say to himself: \"This one thing\n",
    "I do and I do it to the very best of my ability. My purpose is sure and steady. My aim is\n",
    "accurate and certain. I hold my thought severely and positively to the work in hand. My\n",
    "endeavor is to do better at each succeeding effort. I take no thought of the morrow, for to-day\n",
    "demands the best that is in me. I move quietly but persistently toward a definite goal. I shall be\n",
    "immensely successful through constant, earnest and sincere application to my work and duty. I\n",
    "grow daily in my power of concentrated effort. I am absorbed in all I do.\"\n",
    "Not only in matters of business should a man concentrate, but in his reading and recreation.\n",
    "This great power brings with it many other valuable elements, such as order, punctuality,\n",
    "thoroughness, self-respect, and self-reliance. Through concentration a man may aspire to the\n",
    "highest achievements. By its aid there is practically no limit to ambition.\n",
    "Buskin says that \"men's proper business in this world falls mainly into three divisions: First, to\n",
    "know themselves, and the existing state of the things they have to do with. Secondly, to be\n",
    "happy in themselves, and in the existing state of things. Thirdly, to mend themselves, and the\n",
    "existing state of things, as far as either are marred or mend able.\"\n",
    "We hear men constantly deploring the fact that they lack concentration, memory, definiteness,\n",
    "and other qualities of excellence, but who make not the slightest effort to cultivate them. Few\n",
    "persons are born with really great gifts; most of the truly great have achieved greatness.\n",
    "Napoleon ascribed his greatest victories to his ability to concentrate his forces on a single point\n",
    "in the enemy. Gladstone was remarkable for this same power. When the great statesman died,\n",
    "Lord Eosebery said: \"My lords, there are two features of Mr. Gladstone's intellect which I can\n",
    "not help noting on this occasion, for they were so signal, so salient, and distinguished him so\n",
    "much from all other minds that I have come in contact with, that it would be wanting to this\n",
    "occasion if they were not noted. The first was his enormous power of concentration! There\n",
    "never was a man, I feel, in this world, who, at any given moment, on any given subject, could\n",
    "so devote every resource and power of his intellect, without the restriction of a single nerve\n",
    "within him, to the immediate purpose of that subject.\" The story is told of an English\n",
    "statesman whose powers of concentration were so great that after a great debate in Parliament,\n",
    "he hurried from the House bareheaded, passed his coach at the door, and walked all the way\n",
    "home in a pouring rain. In the highest form of public speaking men become so absorbed in their\n",
    "subject that they lose for the time being all consideration and thought of everything else. This\n",
    "power is really indispensable to the highest form of extempore address. The great pulpit\n",
    "orators of the world possessed this faculty in preeminent degree. Whitefield, Mirabeau,\n",
    "Wilberforce, Parker, Spurgeon, Beecher, Phillips Brooks, all were men of tremendous\n",
    "earnestness and concentration. John Bright was so completely absorbed in the subject of a\n",
    "forthcoming speech that he brooded over it day and night, talked it over with his friends, andwhen no one else was available discussed it with his gardener.\n",
    "But along with a man's concentration there must be actual performance. Dr. Nicholas Murray\n",
    "Butler says that \"Indefinite absorption without production is fatal both to character and to the\n",
    "highest intellectual power. Do something and be able to do it well; express what you know in\n",
    "some helpful and substantial form; produce, and do not everlastingly feel only and revel in\n",
    "feelings--these are counsels which make for a real education and against that sham form of it\n",
    "which is easily recognized as well-informed incapacity.\" The power of concentration is to be\n",
    "developed so as to enable a man to do better work, to produce the best of which he is capable.\n",
    "It does not mean brooding and meditating, with no thought of action and production. It is to\n",
    "encourage work, not restrain it.\n",
    "It is a mistake to think that concentration means a straining of the mind. On the contrary, it is\n",
    "power in repose. It is not a nervous habit of doing one's work under pressure, but the ease of\n",
    "self-control. Every man should have one great ideal in life toward which he directs his best\n",
    "powers. By constantly keeping that aim before him, by bending his energies to it, he may hope\n",
    "eventually to attain to his highest ideal. When a successful financier was asked the secret of his\n",
    "great success, he said that as a young man he made a strong mental picture of what some day\n",
    "he would become. Day and night he concentrated his powers upon that one goal. There was no\n",
    "feverish haste, no nervous overreaching, no squandering of mental and physical power, but a\n",
    "strong, reposeful, never-wavering determination to make that picture of his youth a living\n",
    "reality. Such is the power of concentration; such is the secret of success."

    "carriage, chest high and active, the back of the neck pressed against the collar, and the manner\n",
    "suggesting power in reserve. In a remarkably short time, by merely \"playing the part,\" he will\n",
    "establish it as a habit, and the mind itself will assume these self-same qualities. Don't forget the\n",
    "order: An act, a habit, a character.\n",
    "A still better way is to hold in the mind a vivid picture of the physical man you would be. Think\n",
    "of yourself as of manly and dignified bearing, with spine strong and straight, shoulders thrown\n",
    "back, countenance clear and frank, the step sure and firm. Think of yourself as positive,\n",
    "deliberate and magnetic. Endeavor to make this picture a reality by putting all this into\n",
    "practice. Resolve to make the most of yourself, beginning not tomorrow but to-day--now. At\n",
    "this moment while you read these words, straighten yourself up, draw in a full deep breath, and\n",
    "ask whether this simple act does not increase your feeling of self-reliance. Avoid the \"leaning\"\n",
    "habit. Many men feel uncomfortable unless they can rest their chin on the hand, cross their\n",
    "legs, or find constant support for their back.\n",
    "The difficult problem of how a busy man may properly exercise is still unsolved. He has tried\n",
    "the gymnasium, but found no inspiration there. There is no fun in exercising at a mechanical\n",
    "rowing machine. He has bought a \"home exerciser,\" but after a few mornings both his\n",
    "enthusiasm and the exerciser disappear. He has bought a library of books on physical culture,\n",
    "but some of their pages are still uncut. What is he to do?\n",
    "Listen:\n",
    "Two minutes devoted regularly each morning upon rising, to half-a-dozen bending, twisting,\n",
    "and stooping movements of the arms, waist and legs, coupled with right habits during the day,\n",
    "will give an average man all the physical exercise he requires.\n",
    "The importance of the daily bath should no longer need to be emphasized. The particular\n",
    "form--whether it be hot or cold, sponge or tub, at night or in the morning--may be adapted to\n",
    "one's particular case, but the entire surface of the body should be washed at least once a day.\n",
    "The reason is not so physiological as it is psychological. A clean body has a most direct and\n",
    "immediate effect upon one's thoughts. The mind telegraphs its message by delicate and\n",
    "mysterious means to all parts of the body. A bath has an intimate relation to a man's soul.\n",
    "Physical up building should be part of a man's every-day life. On his way to the office he can\n",
    "get off the street-car ten blocks away and feel the invigorating effect of walking for the rest of\n",
    "the way. During the day he can rise from his desk, inhale a deep breath six times or more,\n",
    "accompanied by a movement of the arms, and return to his duties refreshed and exhilarated.\n",
    "Especially can he be careful to sit up straight, to breathe deeply, and do his daily work withoutstrain. It is a nervous age, when men do everything under pressure and tension. If such a man\n",
    "would begin his day an hour earlier, he could conduct all his affairs deliberately and even\n",
    "leisurely, and feel that he was always an hour ahead. To start in good time will often obviate\n",
    "the wear and tear of the average business life.\n",
    "The fresh-air fiend has the best side of the argument. There are some persons who still insist\n",
    "that too much fresh air is dangerous, but we know of some of the wonders that have been\n",
    "wrought by this comparatively new treatment. One in very delicate health will be cautious not\n",
    "to overdo this, and will properly be advised by a physician. But for the rank and file of men,\n",
    "more life in the open air would mean to them more joy in their work and greater longevity.\n",
    "It is said that the hopefulness of consumptives is due to accelerated breathing, and that living in\n",
    "the open air produces bodily exhilaration and arouses sanguine expectations even on the edge\n",
    "of the grave. Is it not strange that people who reject stale food, will breathe stale air with\n",
    "perfect complacency? Closed cars, closed offices, closed bedrooms, in these they live the\n",
    "greater part of the day, and wonder they are lacking in self-confidence.\n",
    "It was Huxley who said that \"The health of the mental and bodily functions, the spirit, temper,\n",
    "disposition, correctness of judgment, and brilliancy of imagination, depend directly upon pure\n",
    "air.\" The memory itself depends upon good physiological conditions, and when properly\n",
    "nourished receives better and more enduring impressions.\n",
    "Oxygen is the universal scavenger. Professor Tyndall says _\" _There is assuredly morality in\n",
    "the oxygen of the mountains, as there is immorality in the miasma of a marsh,\" and goes on to\n",
    "say that the purer the stream of blood the greater will be the glow of the heart. When we take\n",
    "air into our lungs the blood absorbs the oxygen and carries it to all parts of the body. After it\n",
    "has performed its life-giving office, it returns with its impure products of combustion as\n",
    "\"cinders of the fire within us.\"\n",
    "Physicians assert that the majority of men do not use three-fourths of their lungs in ordinary\n",
    "respiration. Children who play and run do so, but neither men nor women in their daily\n",
    "occupations exercise their lungs as they should.\n",
    "Which do you prefer to look at, a silver stream of pure flowing water, or a muddy one? Which\n",
    "would you prefer to have flowing through the arteries of your body, a stream of red blood or a\n",
    "muddy one! If you would be self-confident, live out-of-doors as much as possible, breathe\n",
    "pure fresh air, and be a lover of nature, for, as Humboldt says: '' Mere communion with nature,\n",
    "mere contact with the free air, exercise a soothing yet strengthening influence on the wearied\n",
    "spirit.\"\n",
    "One of the most favorable times to practice deep breathing, coupled with positive mental\n",
    "suggestion, is immediately after retiring at night. Lie flat on the back, inhale deeply, slowly,\n",
    "and fully, expanding both the abdomen and chest; then slowly exhale while allowing all the\n",
    "parts to relax gently. The mind is peculiarly amenable to suggestion just before one goes to\n",
    "sleep. Positive suggestions made at this time sink deeply into the consciousness and become a\n",
    "permanent part of one's personality. The student will find it helpful in connection with this\n",
    "exercise to impress his mind with the thoughts he seeks to materialize in his life and character.\n",
    "He may formulate his own sentences, and mentally repeat them several times with great\n",
    "sincerity and positiveness. He may say: \"I am growing daily in self-confidence. I have\n",
    "unlimited power within me. Tonight I shall rest calmly and cheerfully. I now relax every part of\n",
    "my body, and shall have deep refreshing sleep. All my power comes from God and I commendmyself to His care. I shall to-night gather new power for the new day. I am an immortal soul,\n",
    "and know no limitation. My arms and legs grow heavy, my head is heavy, my eyelids are\n",
    "heavy, my entire body is heavy, heavy, heavy as lead, and my mind is relaxed, completely\n",
    "relaxed, and I grow sleepy, sleepy, sleepy.\"\n",
    "At a banquet given in New York to Herbert Spencer, the eminent thinker was fearful that he\n",
    "would inadequately express himself on that occasion because of impaired health. \"Any failure,\"\n",
    "said he, \"in my response you must please ascribe, in part at least, to a greatly disordered\n",
    "nervous system.'' Here was fear- thought arising directly from physical weakness. \"Without\n",
    "good health there can not be endurance, and therefore little confidence in one's abilities.\n",
    "Gladstone owed his wonderful staying powers to robust health, maintained by careful\n",
    "mastication of his food and exercise in chopping down trees. His splendid physical powers\n",
    "were the basis of his more wonderful eloquence.\n",
    "The marvel of it all is that the human body endures so much abuse and neglect. Here are\n",
    "upward of two hundred bones, and more than twice as many muscles, and yet many men\n",
    "expect this wonderfully intricate and complex machine to run itself! Is it any wonder that a well\n",
    "and healthy man is so rarely seen?\n",
    "A common source of ill-health comes from the worry habit. In its aggravated form this is said\n",
    "to cause cancer. Plow- ever that may be, we know that it does cause endless trouble and grief.\n",
    "The time and energy that are often spent in worry would be sufficient, if properly applied, to\n",
    "remove wholly the cause of worry. Timid men are much addicted to this debilitating habit.\n",
    "They worry not only about the past but about what is to come. This is particularly noticeable in\n",
    "the case of a diffident man who knows he must make a speech at some function or other. He\n",
    "spends his days and nights, not so much in diligent preparation as in worrying over the thought\n",
    "of embarrassment and failure. He spends sleepless nights in thinking how he will surely\n",
    "discredit himself in the eyes of all his friends, and when he stands before them to speak he has\n",
    "lost all natural control of his powers.\n",
    "To cure the worry habit it is of little practical use to say \"Don't worry.\" A man so afflicted\n",
    "should ask himself pertinent questions, such as, what am I worrying about? How can I remedy\n",
    "the matter? When he knows what should be done, let him proceed to do it. Perhaps it looks\n",
    "impossible. Let him at least try. Upon close analysis we very often find that the matter we have\n",
    "been worrying about is not worth it. Why, for instance, should a man rack body and soul over\n",
    "a few dollars? If a man owes you money and will not pay it, is it not better to cancel the debt\n",
    "than to cancel your health and peace of mind? Your worrying man exerts a bad influence. It\n",
    "was a rule of one of the Roth s child s, a great financier, not to have anything to do with an\n",
    "unlucky man or an unlucky plan. Why? Because the man who has been unlucky gets to think\n",
    "himself unlucky and is commonly a man who worries. Through contact with him, you readily\n",
    "get into your system the microbe of discontent and presently two worrying men spring up\n",
    "where only one was before. No one cares to meet the long-faced man, the man with the\n",
    "hard-luck story. The reason is evident. We know that a man who takes time to grumble and\n",
    "complain is taking that time from actual hard work. To worry is to acknowledge that things\n",
    "and events are too large for you, and that you are in some way inferior. The man who is intent\n",
    "upon building a high degree of self-confidence will avoid worry, real or imaginary, and if he\n",
    "has a grievance he will lose it in his work.\n",
    "In these bustling times it is well to be on one's guard against the habit of nervousness. Many\n",
    "men are living at too intense a pace. The expenditure of nerve force is out of proportion to the\n",
    "supply, and actual results do not warrant the high price of worn out, nervous, physicalcollapse, and premature death. At the end of a year, a man of poise will achieve many times\n",
    "more than a nervous, erratic person, who possibly spends half his time in rectifying hasty\n",
    "mistakes. Every man, then, should cultivate poise. Like a piece of finely adjusted machinery,\n",
    "his thoughts and acts should be carried on without strain or friction. But let it be remembered\n",
    "that poise begins in the mind and should be developed there that it may express itself in the\n",
    "outward life of a man. As Horatio W. Dresser says: \"Let us seek first that calmness which\n",
    "spares us the petty frictions of life, then gradually attain adjustment. Since it is the little interior\n",
    "friction, the mental worry and the nervous tension which wear us out, we should pause and let\n",
    "down the tension, take off the strain. Inner poise we must have if we would be outwardly at\n",
    "peace; and poise is a balance of opposites, a nice adjustment; such that we move along with the\n",
    "stream of life, instead of against it.\"\n",
    "A man should not work at his maximum. There should be something in reserve for the extra\n",
    "\"spurt\" that may be demanded by some emergency. Self-confidence depends in no little degree\n",
    "upon reserve power. To use up one's vitality as quickly as it is generated, is to live close to the\n",
    "danger-line. Then one day something snaps, and we see a man moving about uncertainly, like a\n",
    "steamer that has been crippled and disabled in mid-ocean and sends out signals for help.\n",
    "Every man should have a playtime for at least a small part of each day, and a reasonably long\n",
    "vacation every summer. Good health is impossible when the machinery works incessantly\n",
    "during many years. There must be rest and relaxation, a change of air and scene, a new line of\n",
    "thought, a larger and better outlook. Said a successful publisher, \"I would keep better hours if\n",
    "I were a boy again. I would go to bed earlier. Sleep is our great replenisher. If we sit up late,\n",
    "we decay, and sooner or later we contract a disease called insomnia. Late hours are shadows\n",
    "from the grave.\"\n",
    "A prominent clergyman declares that many business men go to see him, broken down in the\n",
    "prime of life just when they should be in the best condition for real work. He attributes their\n",
    "trouble not to laziness but to strenuousness. They have been using one set of their powers too\n",
    "much, and other powers perhaps not at all. To this want of balance and harmony, he ascribes\n",
    "their premature downfall.\n",
    "Health is too precious to be thus frittered away. Young men particularly should take warning\n",
    "from the object-lessons they have on all sides. Too many men are breaking down at thirty-five\n",
    "and forty, and three-score-and-ten\" is more and more becoming the exception.\n",
    "When a nervous, diffident man asks: \"Will the use of alcohol or tobacco impair my chances of\n",
    "becoming self-confident?\" we invariably answer, \"Yes, most emphatically.\" We have already\n",
    "said that a high degree of good health is essential to a high degree of self-confidence.\n",
    "Anything, then, that affects the one affects the other. Alcohol is an irritant. If indulged in it will\n",
    "tell against the bodily tissues sooner or later. A self-confident man should be a good speaker,\n",
    "but the use of tobacco directly affects the delicate lining of the throat, and a habitual smoker\n",
    "finds in time that his voice loses its clearness and brilliancy. Irritation of throat leads to more\n",
    "serious troubles, susceptibility to \"sore throat\" increases, and in time the speaker begins to lose\n",
    "his nerve. Exceptions to this, it is true, may be found, but in a general way both the drinking\n",
    "and the smoking habit are detrimental to the building of self-reliance."

    "FINDING YOURSELF\n",
    "It is said that the lobster when washed high and dry makes no effort to get back into the water,\n",
    "but waits for the sea to come to him. If it does, well and good; if it does not, he simply dies.\n",
    "There are literally thousands of men who complain that no one helps them, and who frown\n",
    "upon the success of others as due wholly to good luck or the influence of friends. The time\n",
    "spent in bemoaning their lot, if applied to honest endeavor, would yield splendid results and\n",
    "give them their proper place in the world. Such men have not found themselves.\n",
    "There is another class of persons who are fairly successful, but work with their left hand. That\n",
    "is to say, they are at constant disadvantage because they have not learned to do their work in\n",
    "the best way. For example, a man may perform the duties of the day as an automaton, and, like\n",
    "a machine, wear out. As the years go by he becomes less and less valuable, and finally goes\n",
    "down under the general classification of failure. Or a man limits himself by the belief that he\n",
    "must be on a fixed salary, that he can not risk branching out for himself. If reproached for his\n",
    "lack of ambition, his excuse is that all men cannot be principals, that some must fill the\n",
    "subordinate positions. This may be true, but he should not play \"second fiddle\" any longer than\n",
    "he must. There may be rare cases where a man has reached the limit of his lifting power, and\n",
    "there remains for him only the task of doing his particular work the best he can. But many\n",
    "others are conscious of not doing their best, not pressing forward to a higher place in the\n",
    "world, not using their powers as they should. These men have not yet found themselves.\n",
    "There is still another class who live an artificial life, constantly striving to appear what they are\n",
    "not and never can be. The result is they do not find their real selves, and largely for lack of a\n",
    "little common sense. There is a false pride and a real pride. The right kind of pride is one of the\n",
    "greatest spurs to ambition. We see this illustrated in persons who are short in stature, or who\n",
    "are handicapped by some physical defect. In order to measure up to others, they will put forth\n",
    "Herculean efforts in other directions. If Napoleon had been an inch taller he probably would\n",
    "never have been a great commander, for, as a writer says: \"It was the nickname of 'Little\n",
    "Corporal' that probably first pricked the sides of his ambition, and stung him into that terrible\n",
    "activity which made all Europe tremble.\" A man should give little thought to his weaknesses,\n",
    "but concentrate his time and energies upon the best that is in him. The way to conquer\n",
    "difficulties is to wear them out by hard work. Let a man subject himself to severe self-analysis.\n",
    "Let him determine to be severely honest in this examination. If he really has limitations he\n",
    "should recognize them and keep within them. If he has unused powers, let him develop them.\n",
    "If he has defects that are holding him back, let him eradicate them. If he feels he is capable of\n",
    "greater things, let him attempt them.\n",
    "The best school at last is the world, and the best teacher is one's self. Any one who ever\n",
    "becomes four-fourths of a man must learn to think for himself. Teachers may guide him in an\n",
    "elementary way, but at length he is placed upon his own resources, and it is only then that his\n",
    "real development is possible. Of course many men are dependent all their lives. They want\n",
    "others to do all their \"sums,\" carry all their responsibilities, plan for them, work for them, and\n",
    "even suffer for them. These men never find themselves.\n",
    "How readily a man is placed in the estimation of others. Here is one who is constantly joking,\n",
    "or talking about things of no importance. He is treated with indifference and even with\n",
    "discourtesy. He has placed himself low down in the social scale, and no one takes him\n",
    "seriously. Another man, perhaps with no greater natural abilities, is dignified in thought andbearing, has a high sense of his personal worth, and believes himself to be the equal of other\n",
    "men. Others do not dare to belittle him, for his manner instantly disarms any such intention.\n",
    "To this extent he has found himself, has taken his place among the world of men.\n",
    "A strong motive is a compelling force in a man's life. If he sets before him a high aim, and\n",
    "realizes what it will mean to attain it, he will probably bend every nerve to that one definite\n",
    "end. Such a man will make himself worthy of the respect of others. In his personal appearance,\n",
    "and thought, and conversation, he will instantly commend himself to others He will seek to\n",
    "develop judgment and far-sightedness. He will be industrious. He will seek the counsel of\n",
    "other men. He will be guided by his intuition and conscience. When he believes a thing is right\n",
    "he will do it; when he knows a thing is wrong he will avoid it. He will make each day count\n",
    "toward his certain progress. He will find himself by discovering and developing all that is good\n",
    "and best in him. To such a man any reasonable achievement is possible. Sir Thomas Buxton\n",
    "said, \"The longer I live, the more I am certain that the great difference between men, between\n",
    "the great and the insignificant, is energy, invincible determination, an honest purpose once\n",
    "fixed, and then death or victory. This quality will do anything in the world; and no talents, no\n",
    "circumstances; will make a two-legged creature a man without it.\" This has been the animating\n",
    "spirit of the world's great men. This must be the ruling principle of any one who eventually\n",
    "finds himself.\n",
    "\"We have more force than will,\" says La Eochefoucauld, \"and it is often merely to excuse\n",
    "ourselves that we imagine certain things are impossible.\" It is easier to let things take their\n",
    "course than to make a path for ourselves, easier to accept the opinions of others than patiently\n",
    "to formulate judgments of our own. But independence and self-reliance are essential elements\n",
    "of greatness. A man must learn to do his own thinking and planning. Doctor Tilley in his\n",
    "inspiring book, \"Masters of the Situation,\" says: \"Every man carries within himself to a great\n",
    "extent his own destiny. Undaunted will, unflinching energy, ever and everywhere make their\n",
    "mark and bring success. In business, who is the man who succeeds? The man who thinks\n",
    "clearly, who plans wisely, and executes promptly and with untiring energy.\"\n",
    "A man who is not getting on in the world as he should may well question himself thus: What is\n",
    "it I lack to insure success? Why have I not accomplished what I set out to do? Wherein may I\n",
    "profit from my experience as well as that of others? In what way can I better regulate my life?\n",
    "Are there not larger and better ways to employ the abilities I have now? How can I set to work\n",
    "this very day to advance myself to higher things? To what end does my present course lead?\n",
    "Am I surely on the right road, and why am I sure? If I am not on the right road, what is the\n",
    "best way to get on it? Am I improving my powers daily? Am I fitting myself for larger\n",
    "usefulness? These and similar questions will disclose a man to himself, show him his needs,\n",
    "indicate the proper course to pursue, lead him to find himself.\n",
    "Procrastination will weaken the strongest resolution. The thing that is right to do to-day should\n",
    "be done to-day. Tomorrow a man may have lost his enthusiasm. To-day is the time to strike\n",
    "and to strike hard. No man willingly cares to be classified with the ne'er-do- wells, the\n",
    "non-producers, the shiftless and aimless, who are to be seen on every hand; yet thousands\n",
    "unthinkingly do not rise very far above this class for lack of proper ambition and diligence.\n",
    "Max O'Eell, the French humorist, said: \"Luck means rising at six o'clock in the morning; living\n",
    "on a dollar a day if you can earn two; minding your own business, and not meddling with other\n",
    "people's. Luck means appointments you have never failed to keep; trains you have never failed\n",
    "to catch.\" Here is philosophy in a nutshell for the man who would make the most of his power\n",
    "and opportunities. Let him rise early in the day that he may have every advantage; let himexercise reasonable economy in order to become independent; let him meet every obligation\n",
    "promptly that his name may be a source of capital; above all else, let him keep constantly\n",
    "before his mind a lofty ambition to which he gives unceasing and energetic devotion.\n",
    "Let every discouraged man remember that Washington lost more battles than he won, but out\n",
    "of his failures he organized success. Neither Demosthenes nor Webster, whose names are\n",
    "associated as the world's two greatest orators, was a good speaker in his youth. In both cases\n",
    "an impediment spurred them to study oratory. Hundreds of men might be cited who achieved\n",
    "distinction mainly because of obstacles to be overcome. Like Lord Chatham, they trampled\n",
    "upon impossibilities. \"The battle is completely lost,\" said an intrepid commander, \"but it is only\n",
    "two o'clock, and we shall have time to gain another.\" No matter how many times a man has\n",
    "failed in the battle of life, he may still hope for success if he can courageously say: \"It is only\n",
    "two o'clock, and I shall win yet!\""

    "GENERAL HABITS\n",
    "Confidence is marked by composure, fear by haste. It is the sum of a man's habits that\n",
    "determines what he is. Few people realize the difference between the thought habits of a\n",
    "fearful man and those of one who is self-confident.\n",
    "The man with fearthought in his mind goes to the fields for a morning walk. He looks timidly\n",
    "about him for possible run-away horses. As he walks along, he examines the grass lest a snake\n",
    "suddenly run up his trousers. He hears the mooing of a cow and has visions of the animal\n",
    "charging him, or possibly a distant voice startles him into thinking he is trespassing on private\n",
    "grounds. Meanwhile, with his mind overcharged with these and other fearthoughts, he misses\n",
    "all the beauty and invigorating effect of his environment. A self-confident man, on the contrary,\n",
    "sees first, perhaps, the opal tints in the autumn leaves; sees a profusion of wild\n",
    "flowers--golden-rod, ox-eyed daisies, and sweet-scented clover; hears twittering birds and\n",
    "locusts, watches great billows of gray clouds riding the blue, or sees the breakers rolling\n",
    "majestically on the shore. He sniffs the breeze into his nostrils, and looking heavenward\n",
    "exclaims: \"How wonderfully beautiful is Thy handiwork!\"\n",
    "A man should cultivate his individuality and independence. Let him recognize as early in life as\n",
    "possible that there is a definite place for him in the world which no one else can fill. This\n",
    "should give him a sense of personal pride and a determination to qualify for his high estate.\n",
    "There are, of course, established customs which a man must observe, but he should not\n",
    "hesitate to ignore public opinion if he deem it for the highest good. The world's greatest\n",
    "reformers have been intrepid men, who dared to do right in face of criticism, persecution and\n",
    "even death.\n",
    "Some men devote all their lives to little things and wonder why they never achieve anything\n",
    "worth while. It is as though a man should content himself with conducting a peanut-stand\n",
    "when all the while he might be a great lawyer. Self-imposed limitation, a wrong idea of values,\n",
    "or a narrow and perverted view of life, holds many a man in bondage who might be scaling the\n",
    "heights. It is said that there are still business men who use the backs of old envelopes for\n",
    "scribbling paper while writing-pads may be bought for twenty-five cents a dozen. A mind that\n",
    "is constantly absorbed in little things, that adjusts its eye to see out of the small end of' the\n",
    "telescope, has no place for the large and glorious possibilities of life.\n",
    "A high quality of self-confidence breeds generosity in a man. He can not stoop to do a mean\n",
    "thing. He pays his way wherever he goes--or he doesn't go. He refuses to be a sycophant. A\n",
    "man should remind himself ninety-and-nine times every day to make the most of himself. His\n",
    "mind as well as his body should be constantly disciplined. The effort to put a new set of habits\n",
    "into force should be as continuous as possible, since many broken resolutions eventually\n",
    "weaken character.\n",
    "Self-respect is the very basis of self-confidence. If a man makes little of himself, others will\n",
    "make still less of him. If he fails to observe the conventionalities he may easily suffer in the\n",
    "estimation of others. Obsequiousness is wholly distasteful and instantly writes a man down as\n",
    "inferior. It is possible to be gentle without being effeminate. Gentleness is controlled strength.\n",
    "A strong personality does not move in jerks but in curves, and its consciousness of power frees\n",
    "it from the necessity of going on exhibition. Violence is weakness. It is an admission of\n",
    "inferiority, and repels where it aims to control. Anger is an enemy to self-confidence. Itdissipates a man's forces and lessens his influence with others. It leads him at length to\n",
    "discouragement.\n",
    "A pernicious mental habit is that of discouragement. Instead of mending matters, it aggravates\n",
    "them and works destruction. Difficulties should be met courageously, for when a man says \"I\n",
    "can!\" and \"I will!\" it is marvelous how clouds of discontent may be dissipated. A clenched fist\n",
    "struck upon a table may instantly shake off the shackles of mental servitude. It has been said,\n",
    "indeed, that death itself will wait for a brave spirit. Some men are forever traveling in the\n",
    "wrong direction. \"If I travel straight on from here, how far is it to New York?\" asked a\n",
    "stranger of a passer-by. \"Well,\" said he, \"if you keep straight on the way you are going it is\n",
    "about twenty-five thousand miles, but if you turn around and walk the other way it is about a\n",
    "mile and a half.\" It is not sufficient that one keep going; he must move in the right direction.\n",
    "Doing the wrong thing many times never makes it right. Experience should teach us not to\n",
    "commit the same error twice.\n",
    "Our estimate of a person may completely be reversed by some untoward circumstance. A slight\n",
    "money transaction has been known to destroy a lifelong friendship. A trifling criticism, made in\n",
    "an offensive tone of voice, may turn good-will into deadly hate. It is a canon of good form in\n",
    "conversation that only pleasant things be said of any one. Argument, pedantry, inquisitiveness,\n",
    "and interruption are alike forbidden by tact and considerateness.\n",
    "Every man is more or less conscious at the close of day of duties unfulfilled, of work\n",
    "neglected, or of opportunities lost. He realizes sometimes how much more and better he might\n",
    "have done. He may well ask himself the cause of these repeated failures. Is it lack of will? Is it\n",
    "want of energy, definiteness, or initiative? If he would take conscious possession of the\n",
    "powers within him, all these faculties might quickly be developed. It is not surprising that men\n",
    "fall so far short of their ideal when they make so little effort to attain it.\n",
    "Avoid the hat-in-hand attitude, the habit of seeking favors, and especially that of wishing\n",
    "something for nothing. Independence is a quality of greatness. A letter of introduction easily\n",
    "may be an acknowledgment of weakness. A man who succeeds with such a letter would\n",
    "succeed just as well without it. The important thing after all is the man himself. Senator\n",
    "Beveridge tells young men to give heed to little matters commonly neglected. He says: '' Use\n",
    "clean linen. Wear good and well-fitting clothes. Take care of your shoes. Look after all the\n",
    "details of your personal grooming.\" Who will doubt that Senator Beveridge himself owes his\n",
    "distinction in considerable degree to this careful attention to little things!\n",
    "Courage is admired; fear never is. Courage is dignified; fear is repulsive. A particularly good\n",
    "story is told of a dog named \"Jerry.\" No one knew where he came from, nor what kind of a\n",
    "dog he was, but from the beginning he was kicked and abused as an absolutely worthless\n",
    "animal. His very attitude invited the treatment he invariably received. One could see that he\n",
    "expected to be kicked, and kicked he was. When his farmer-master went to town this dog\n",
    "would slink under the wagon and run along half-scared. The dogs along the route spied him\n",
    "out, however, chased him and fought him until he closely resembled the losing side of the\n",
    "fiercest kind of a dog fight. Altogether he was a very miserable and unhappy dog, and one\n",
    "day, chased by his fellow canines, fell into a trap that had been skillfully arranged by some\n",
    "boys, and down he went into the pit. A little later a young bear of an investigating turn of\n",
    "mind dropt into the pit too, and Jerry at once scented trouble. A series of fights ensued in\n",
    "which the dog seemed to be getting the worst of it, and the bear was putting the final touches\n",
    "on him, when suddenly, Jerry appeared to wake up and to take on a new lease of life. He\n",
    "jumped at the bear's throat and gave him reason for retiring to a corner to reflect a little. Fromthis time on Jerry displayed a large set of teeth not unlike those seen on the top of dentists'\n",
    "sign. He also gave an occasional snarl which caused the bear to remain quietly in his corner.\n",
    "Next morning the boy shot the bear and lifted the dog out of the pit alive. Jerry had completely\n",
    "changed in character, poise and self-respect. He ran toward home with a new self-confident\n",
    "air. His old dog friends did not at first recognize him; when they did the first chased him as\n",
    "usual, but received a surprise that made it necessary for him to be sent to the dog hospital.\n",
    "From this time on Jerry gradually came to be regarded as the biggest dog in town, and he\n",
    "gained the respect and good-will of every dog for miles around.\n",
    "Many a man is like Jerry. \"With fear written across his face, he is denied even before he asks.\n",
    "He is taken advantage of at every turn, for people quickly see what manner of man he is. He\n",
    "applies for a position, but another applicant, with half his ability but twice his self-confidence,\n",
    "wins the preference. At church he is placed in the back pew; at the theater he secures a ticket\n",
    "for a seat behind a pillar; at the hotel he gets the smallest room on the top floor; in the\n",
    "restaurant he gets the toughest steak; in every store the clerks cut him off short or sell him\n",
    "things he does not wish to buy.\n",
    "Every man should cast out this mental fear and take his proper place in the world. He should\n",
    "hold himself erect, and look at the world strongly and bravely. His outward bearing should\n",
    "constantly express the inward realization of true manhood. When such a man becomes the '\n",
    "self-confident, self-respecting, strong, manly man he ought to be, the world will appraise him\n",
    "as such."

    "THE MAN AND THE MANNER\n",
    "The way in which a man is dressed has much to do with his feeling of satisfaction and\n",
    "self-confidence. The advice of an expert to a man who feels things are going against him, is to\n",
    "\"stop and shave, take a bath, and put on a smart, well-fitting suit of clothes.\" A prominent\n",
    "business man acknowledges that when properly dressed he can approach other men with twice\n",
    "his usual degree of self-confidence.\n",
    "Every one has noticed how a person badly dressed becomes self-conscious upon entering into\n",
    "the presence of well-dressed people. He feels suddenly at a disadvantage; a sense of inferiority\n",
    "creeps over him, and his greatest desire is to beat a hasty retreat.\n",
    "It has been said that a well-modulated voice testifies to a strain of good blood in the speaker's\n",
    "ancestry, but it does more than this. It serves as an index to his self-confidence. The degree of\n",
    "earnestness and conviction in the speaker's mind is disclosed in his voice and manner. The\n",
    "instant he speaks he declares himself, and our first estimate will not easily be changed.\n",
    "Diffidence is a serious handicap to any man. \"I hate,\" exclaims Emerson, \"where I looked for a\n",
    "manly furtherance, or at least a manly resistance, to find much of concession.\" Men who lack\n",
    "self-confidence do not hold themselves in high esteem, and others accept them at their own\n",
    "valuation. When a brutal soldier raised his sword to John Milton and said \"I have power to kill\n",
    "you,\" that great souled man replied, \"And I have power to be killed and to despise my\n",
    "murderer.\" It is this dauntless spirit, even in the face of imminent danger, that proves a man's\n",
    "worth.\n",
    "Let a man speak out like a man, not like a weakling. Servility is not politeness, nor are\n",
    "weakness and effeminacy marks of good-breeding.\n",
    "Training in self-confidence belongs properly to childhood. Parents are doubtless responsible\n",
    "for much of the fearthought that prevails in after life. As Chamberlain says:\n",
    "\"Every ugly thing told to the child, every shock, every fright, given him, will remain like\n",
    "splinters in the flesh, to torture him all his life long. The bravest old soldier, the most daring\n",
    "young reprobate, is incapable of forgetting them all the masks, the bogies, ogres, hobgoblins,\n",
    "witches and wizards, the things that bite and scratch, that nip and tear, that pinch and crunch,\n",
    "the thousand-and-one imaginary monsters of the mother, the nurse, or the servant, have had\n",
    "their effect; and hundreds of generations have worked to denaturalize the brains of children.\n",
    "Perhaps no animal, not even those most susceptible to fright, has behind it the fear heredity of\n",
    "the child.\"\n",
    "But if one has reached young manhood and is distressed by timidity and fearthought, let him\n",
    "take courage, from the fact that thousands like him have finally mastered themselves. We have\n",
    "before hinted that such a man must take himself in hand for the most severe mental\n",
    "overhauling. This must be well and thoroughly done, and strong resolutions put into immediate\n",
    "effect. But having made this careful and honest diagnosis of his own case, and decided upon a\n",
    "definite course of action, he should then stop his introspection, stop thinking about his fears\n",
    "and shortcomings, and engage his mind wholly with strong up building thoughts.\n",
    "But this is not all. These thoughts must be translated into acts. The fable of the Hunter and theWoodman reminds us that a hero is brave in deeds as well as in words: \"A hunter, not very\n",
    "bold, was searching for the tracks of a lion. He asked a man who was felling oaks in the forest,\n",
    "if he had seen any marks of his footsteps, or if he knew where his lair was. 'I will,' he said, 'at\n",
    "once show you the lion myself.' The hunter, turning very pale, and with his teeth chattering\n",
    "from fear, replied, 'No, thank you. I did not ask that; it is his track only I am in search of, not\n",
    "the lion himself.' The fault of many men is that they are careless about trifles. It is the little\n",
    "thoughts and acts of a man's every-day life that chiefly enter into the making of his personality.\n",
    "Only once in a great while can one hope to perform some signal act of bravery, but the courage\n",
    "of little things can be manifested every hour of the day. When a friend called the second time\n",
    "on Michelangelo he found him still working at the same statue. '' You have been idle,\" he\n",
    "exclaimed, \"since I saw you last.\" \"No, indeed,\" answered the sculptor--\"I have retouched this\n",
    "part, and polished that; I have softened this feature, and brought out this muscle. I have given\n",
    "more expression to this lip and more energy to this limb.\" \"But,\" said his friend, \"these are\n",
    "trifles.\" \"It may be so,\" replied Michelangelo, \"but please recollect that trifles make perfection\n",
    "and that perfection is no trifle.\"\n",
    "It is through care in apparently unimportant things that a man builds confidence and character.\n",
    "\"By systematic discipline all men may be made heroes,\" and one may say with Shakespeare, \"I\n",
    "dare do all that may become a man; who dares do more is none.\"\n",
    "A man unconsciously expresses himself in his manner. He attracts or repels by voice, look,\n",
    "gesture, walk, or appearance. He is liked or disliked on the instant. He pleases or arouses\n",
    "prejudices, warms or chills one, persuades or discourages, and often can not give the reason\n",
    "why. But let him be sure of himself, and his certainty and confidence will inspire these same\n",
    "qualities in others. \"If a man,\" says Emerson, \"will but plant himself on his instincts, the great\n",
    "world will come round to him.\"\n",
    "A man who is given much to levity loses in public estimation. The professional joker is too\n",
    "capricious to be accepted seriously, and the self-assurance with which he perpetrates his\n",
    "tiresome and superannuated jokes is not the kind of self-confidence we recommend. The basis\n",
    "of the truly self-reliant man, like that of the great orator, is serious, strong-willed, and earnest.\n",
    "Modesty is not incompatible with power and self-confidence. '' A man never speaks of himself\n",
    "without loss,\" wrote Montaigne. It is not too much to say, indeed, that a man who talks much\n",
    "about himself is fundamentally weak. A strong, self-reliant person should attract attention to\n",
    "what he says more than to what he is. Whately's description of the difference between two\n",
    "orators applies also to men in private intercourse. \"When the moon shines brightly,\" he says,\n",
    "\"we are apt to exclaim, 'How beautiful is the moonlight!' but in the daytime we say, 'How\n",
    "beautiful are the trees, the fields, the mountains!'--and, in short, all objects that are illuminated;\n",
    "we never speak of the sun that makes them so. Just in the same way, the really greatest orator\n",
    "shines like the sun, making you think much of the things he is speaking of; the second-best\n",
    "shines like the moon, making you think much of him and his eloquence.'' This sinking of self in\n",
    "one's words and work should be the earnest and constant aim of every student of\n",
    "self-confidence. It is one of the marks of greatness.\n",
    "\"Be gentle, and keep your voice low,\" says the motto. Self-confidence does not imply that a\n",
    "man should be bold and boisterous, scattering everything around him like \"a bull in a\n",
    "china-shop,\" and intimidating every one who ventures to cross his track. Self-confidence means\n",
    "considerateness and gentleness, a due regard for the rights and feelings of others, and a desire\n",
    "to please as well as to affirm. Balzac says:\"Gentleness in the gait is what simplicity is in the dress. Violent gesture or quick movement\n",
    "inspires involuntary disrespect. One looks for a moment at a cascade, but one sits for hours,\n",
    "lost in thought, and gazing upon the still water of a lake. A deliberate gait, gentle manners, and\n",
    "a gracious tone of voice all of which may be acquired--give a mediocre man an immense\n",
    "advantage over those vastly superior to him. To be boldly tranquil, to speak little, and to digest\n",
    "without effort are absolutely necessary to grandeur of mind or of presence, or to proper\n",
    "development of genius.\"\n",
    "Let the student of self-confidence cultivate a high grade of dignity. Over familiarity may easily\n",
    "result in self-consciousness and embarrassment. We resent the style and manner of certain men\n",
    "who greet you by your first name, slap you on the back, poke you in the ribs, call you a good\n",
    "fellow, inquire into your private affairs, and invite themselves to spend their vacation at your\n",
    "summer home. They call at inopportune times, engage you in long and tedious conversation,\n",
    "make unseasonable comments, while all the while you are mentally planning how most\n",
    "expeditiously to get rid of them.\n",
    "Learn to greet people pleasantly. Show them at once that you are interested in what they say.\n",
    "Be a willing and sympathetic listener. Give to them the best that is in you. Do not intrude your\n",
    "own affairs, and especially your troubles, upon them. Remember that the more you think and\n",
    "talk about yourself, the less interesting you will be to others. Your constant attitude of mind\n",
    "should be that of a strong, self-confident man, expressing your power not in self-praise, but in\n",
    "deeds."

    "THE DISCOURAGED MAN\n",
    "When a man loses faith in himself he quickly forfeits the confidence and respect of others.\n",
    "Discouragement if allowed full sway may undermine the stoutest character. It often begins\n",
    "with some trifling matter, a passing disappointment perhaps, which imagination and feeling\n",
    "proceed to magnify into a mountain. A man broods over it day and night, instead of promptly\n",
    "casting it aside, until to him it has become an insurmountable obstacle.\n",
    "Only recently a man of this type had so completely lost his grip that he could no longer go in\n",
    "person to seek employment, but sent his wife instead. She called upon a leading business house\n",
    "to speak for her husband, but no engagement followed. Why? Because they wanted some one\n",
    "who would be called upon to speak for them, and they felt that he must first be able to speak\n",
    "for himself. A man who lacks the self-confidence to go out into the business world to seek\n",
    "employment, is not likely to be successful in securing customers.\n",
    "When a man finds himself in this condition the remedy is quite simple. It is a matter of taking\n",
    "hold afresh, of finding a new starting-point. He should reason with himself something like this:\n",
    "I have a mind, I have hands, I have feet, I have physical strength, and I am certainly equal to\n",
    "many men who are now employed and are succeeding. If I apply myself in the right way,\n",
    "positively and persistently, I am sure to win. I am absolutely sure of it.\" Merely to think such\n",
    "thoughts as these gives him the desired starting point, and so he begins to plan. We recall a\n",
    "case of this kind, where a man had lost his spirit, and felt that opportunity had passed him by\n",
    "for the last time. One night the overmastering thought came to him that he was as good and as\n",
    "capable as thousands of other men, and then and there he determined to put forth the mightiest\n",
    "effort within him. Next morning he dressed himself in the best suit of clothes he had, assumed a\n",
    "happy expression of face, and went to the business section of the city to find a position. If he\n",
    "had been like some timid men, he would have given up at the first sign of refusal. If he had said\n",
    "to himself that he would go down town and look around, but that he did not think he would\n",
    "get anything, there would probably have been no success for him. But he had made up his mind\n",
    "that there was a place for him somewhere, and he was determined to find it.\n",
    "At the first place where he inquired, he was told that the principal was very busy and that he\n",
    "could not see him. \"But I must see him,\" was his prompt answer; \"the matter is important\n",
    "enough for me to wait, and I will wait until he can see me.\" To-day this man whom we have\n",
    "described occupies a high and responsible position at the head of a large and prosperous\n",
    "organization.\n",
    "Young men should be amenable to advice. They should seek the counsel and experience of\n",
    "older men, and learn to avoid their mistakes and emulate their good example. A man should\n",
    "temper his boldness with good sense. Self-confidence should not close a man's mind to the\n",
    "valuable lessons that can be learned on all sides. He should associate with self-reliant men,\n",
    "listen to their talk, observe their ways and habits, both of speech and conduct, and catch their\n",
    "spirit of manhood and independence.\n",
    "Too much introspection is fatal. It is well to examine one's resources from time to time, but to\n",
    "dwell much upon one's own faults and shortcomings, or on \"what might have been,\" is\n",
    "disastrous to real progress. Why should a man forever dwell upon little, negative, worthless\n",
    "and insignificant things in his nature, when he possesses so much else that is good and noble?\n",
    "Let a man not give even the time necessary to denial of the weak and false that may be in him,but give all his time and energy to developing his divine gifts.\n",
    "Some men do not begin to live and do things until they are fifty or more. A successful business\n",
    "man tells us that he seems to have been preparing all his life for the great work he is now doing\n",
    "at the age of fifty-five. No man should feel discouraged because of age. It is a mistake to say,\n",
    "\"I am too old to do this,\" \"Nowadays they want younger men,\" \"Anything is good enough for\n",
    "me now,\" \"It isn't worth the struggle,\" or \"I've lost my hold.\" As long as a man has health,\n",
    "there should be a place for him in the world, and the older he is the more valuable should be his\n",
    "experience.\n",
    "We have met elderly people who might have been doing useful work of some kind, but who\n",
    "repeated over and over again such negative phrases as, \"My day is passed,\" \"If I could only\n",
    "live my life over,'' \"I wasn't brought up right,\" \"I'm tired of living,\" \"I was too honest,\" \"I\n",
    "should have saved,\" \"I must take a back seat,\" \"I married too soon,\" \"The end is not far off,\"\n",
    "\"I'll welcome death,\" \"Hope I'll go soon,\" \"Be sure not to bury me alive.\" A man should not\n",
    "dissipate his energies by attempting too many things. It is well to have a clearly-defined object\n",
    "in view and to concentrate all one's forces upon that. In his inspiring work, \"Getting on in the\n",
    "World,\" William Matthews says: \"One well-cultivated talent, deepened and enlarged, is worth\n",
    "a hundred shallow faculties. The first law of success in this day, when so many things are\n",
    "clamoring for attention, is concentration--to bend all the energies to one point, and to go\n",
    "directly to that point, looking neither to the right nor to the left.\"\n",
    "Men constantly bemoan their lack of opportunity, when all about them are more opportunities\n",
    "than they possibly can use. Some say they can not get along because they are without capital.\n",
    "But how did many of the rich men of to-day make a start fifty years ago? In many instances\n",
    "they were poor boys. What they have done can be done over and over again. It is not\n",
    "opportunity that men lack, but diligence. The human race contains a natural streak of laziness.\n",
    "To do things worth while, a man must lift himself up above animal desire for ease and comfort,\n",
    "set his will to work and his heart on fire with zeal for achievement. A. T. Stewart started life\n",
    "with a dollar and fifty cents. This merchant prince began by calling at the doors of houses in\n",
    "order to sell needles, thread, and buttons. He soon found the people did not want them, and his\n",
    "small stock was thrown back on his hands. Then he said wisely, \"I'll not buy any more of these\n",
    "goods, but I'll go and ask people what they do want.\" There after he studied the needs and\n",
    "desires of people, found out just what they most wanted, endeavored to meet those wants, and\n",
    "became the greatest business man of his time.\n",
    "Procrastination may easily rob a man of his inheritance. Lack of decision may lead to as\n",
    "disastrous results as lack of brains. A man says to himself, '' I will do it to-morrow, I do not\n",
    "feel like it to-day,\" but, lose this day loitering--'twill be the same story tomorrow, and the next\n",
    "more dilatory; the indecision brings its own delays, and days are lost lamenting over days. Are\n",
    "you in earnest? Seize this very minute, what you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness\n",
    "has genius, power and magic in it, only engage and then the mind grows heated--begin, and\n",
    "then the work will be completed. The difference between a self-confident and a timid man,\n",
    "between success and failure, often lies in the two words, \"I will!\" Strong determination to do\n",
    "or die has distinguished all the great men of history. The pertinacity of Grant was expressed in\n",
    "the phrase, \"I intend to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.\" Many men give up just\n",
    "as victory is within sight. A little more patience and staying power and all would have been\n",
    "won. If a man's mind is weak and vacillating, he can strengthen it by saying, \"I will!\" If he has\n",
    "lost faith in himself, he may begin again by saying, \"I will!\" Let him read the lives of resolute\n",
    "men, and mingle with people who do things. Soon there will spring up in his mind and life this\n",
    "wonderful power to will and do. It is a useful habit to take little disappointments as a matterof course, and to crowd them out as fast as they enter the mind by fixing the attention upon big\n",
    "values and fundamentals. If things do not go just right, take a little trip into the country. When\n",
    "you return you will probably find they have untangled themselves, or are not quite as bad as\n",
    "you thought.\n",
    "At the first approach of discouragement, a man should rouse himself out of his lethargy, and\n",
    "go forth into the open air with some inspiring lines upon his lips like these by \"Susan\n",

    "A plan is here offered to the student whereby he may systematically develop a high type of\n",
    "manly self-confidence. He may begin on any day of the month, with the lesson assigned for\n",

    "developed in his character and what repressed. It is important for a good beginning that he be\n",
    "optimistic, looking for the best both in himself and in others. </font> The difference between seeing the\n",
    "bright and the dark side of life is almost the difference between success and failure. The student\n",
    "should remember that wisdom is not a mere accumulation of cold and dry facts, but that \"In\n",
    "the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found.\" <font color='blue'> There can be no real self-culture\n",
    "without real earnestness. Half-hearted efforts produce nothing worth while. </font> As the student's\n",
    "powers unfold, he will more and more realize what unlimited possessions he has for\n",
    "development. <font color='blue'> His enthusiasm, however, must not run away with his judgment, since patience\n",
    "and deliberateness will be a necessary part of his work. The lamp of faith should be kept\n",
    "constantly burning in order that no shadows of discouragement hinder his progress. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> His unselfishness will manifest itself in systematic thinking of other people's interests. </font> He will\n",

    "promptly, and to put new resolutions into immediate practice; to build and guard his health;\n",
    "and to have frequent periods of silence for needful meditation and self-analysis. </font> <font color='blue'> His\n",
    "self-confidence, meanwhile, will increase, and he will no longer depreciate himself, </font> but think of\n",
    "the wonderful resources within him. <font color='blue'> Through sincerity he will cultivate his power of\n",
    "concentration, which will enable him to do thoroughly everything he undertakes. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> A man without affection would become a mere machine. The student of self-culture develops\n",
    "his heart as well as his brain. He cultivates a genuine love for people, nature, books, music,\n",
    "painting, and sculpture, and for the good and beautiful everywhere. </font> So his power grows and\n",
    "multiplies, and he becomes conscious of having increased his reserve force. <font color='blue'> In turn he\n",
    "cultivates temperance, sympathy, and geniality, until these qualities become conspicuous in his\n",
    "daily life and character. He seeks the truth and speaks it as he knows it. His purity of mind and\n",
    "heart renders his life pure. </font>\n",

    "his imagination he holds a picture of what he would be in his life. <font color='blue'> So by means of systematic\n",

    "IMAGINATION AND INITIATIVE\n",
    "Every great work in the world first has its place in the human imagination. If a man is about to\n",
    "build a bench, he first pictures in his own mind the kind of bench it should be. Similarly the\n",
    "painter, architect, contractor, or manufacturer, traces in his imagination an image of that which\n",
    "he would produce.\n",
    "The imagination, then, is a gallery in which we hang pictures, both of what we have done and\n",
    "what we intend to do. We may not always turn these pictures into realities at once, but they are\n",
    "there to interest and encourage us, and to come to our aid when needed. Upon one occasion\n",
    "Webster used, in one of his speeches, an illustration that he had carried in his imagination for\n",
    "fifteen years. Beecher, who was endowed with an unusually vivid imagination, placed this\n",
    "faculty first in importance in the making of a preacher.\n",
    "He affirmed that a man with a trained imagination could not possibly wear out or become\n",
    "uninteresting to his congregation, and asked pertinently: \"Did you ever hear anybody say that\n",
    "spring has been worn out? It has been coming for thousands of years, and it is just as sweet,\n",
    "just as welcome, and just as new, as if the birds sang for the first time; and so it will be for a\n",
    "thousand years to come.''\n",
    "If it be important that a man have a clear and accurate image of what his material product is to\n",
    "be, how much more important is it that he have a picture of the character and life he is\n",
    "building. It has well been said that no man ever made his mark in the world who did not have a\n",
    "master passion for some one thing. When a boy is scribbling a picture on paper and in answer\n",
    "to your question tells you he doesn't know what it is going to be, you feel sure it will not\n",
    "amount to much. When you ask a youth what calling he intends to follow, and he replies that\n",
    "he has not yet made up his mind, you begin to fear for his success. But what will you say to a\n",
    "man who at thirty, forty, and even fifty, has not determined what his life's ambition is, to what\n",
    "ultimate goal he is working? May not the fact that less than five per cent of men succeed be\n",
    "attributed to this aimless, hit-or-miss way of living one's life?\n",
    "In the imagination we find again much of the difference between the timid and self-confident\n",
    "man. One pictures defeat and failure, the other sees himself as successful and influential. One\n",
    "man thinks of all the ways in which he will fail, photographs them upon his mind, places them\n",
    "in the gallery of his imagination, there to haunt him day and night. The other man thinks of the\n",
    "one way in which he will succeed sketches himself as a strong, noble, courageous character,\n",
    "places the picture before his mind's eye, delights in it by day and dreams of it by night.\n",
    "Fear is nowhere else more destructive than in the imagination. It is often a greater enemy than\n",
    "the thing feared. We have all heard of the soldier, a prisoner who was experimented upon many\n",
    "years ago, blindfolded and then told he was bleeding to death, while merely water was trickling\n",
    "from his arm. When subsequently examined he was found to be dead, although not the slightest\n",
    "injury had been done to his body. The fearthought had so completely possessed him that he\n",
    "believed he was actually bleeding to death. Fear sometimes rises from over-caution, but\n",
    "frequently is the result of selfishness. William James puts it in a strong, appealing way when he\n",
    "says: '' The attitude of unhappiness is not only painful, it is mean and ugly. What can be more\n",
    "base and unworthy than the pining, puling, mumpy mood, no matter by what outward ills it\n",
    "may have been engendered? What is more injurious to others? We ought to scout it in\n",
    "ourselves and others, and never show it tolerance.\" Physicians tell us that nine-tenths of the ills\n",
    "of their patients are imaginary. In many instances a breads pill is all that is necessary to affect acomplete cure.\n",
    "We all know of persons who think themselves born under an unlucky star, or pursued by some\n",
    "unhappy fate. Their imagination is crowded with pictures of the direful things that will surely\n",
    "happen to them sooner or later. They reproach themselves for physical weakness, lack of\n",
    "memory, want of ambition, fear of failure, inability to attract friends, or other short comings.\n",
    "Instead of resolutely setting out to develop themselves, they exhaust their remaining powers in\n",
    "useless regrets. They are for all the world like the \"limp\" people described in an English\n",
    "magazine, utterly unable to initiate a single thing on their own behalf.\n",
    "\"A molluscous man,\" it says, \"too suddenly ejected from his long-accustomed groove, where,\n",
    "like a toad embedded in the rock, he had made his niche exactly fitting to his own shape,\n",
    "presents a wretched picture of helplessness and unshiftiness. In vain his friends suggest this or\n",
    "that independent endeavor; he shakes his head, and says he can't it won't do; what he wants is\n",
    "a place where he is not obliged to depend on himself, where he has to do a fixed amount of\n",
    "work for a fixed amount of salary, and where his fiberless plasticity may find a mold ready\n",
    "formed, into which it may run without the necessity of forging shapes for itself. Many a man\n",
    "of respectable intellectual powers has gone down to ruin, and died miserably, because of his\n",
    "limpness, which made it impossible for him to break new ground, or to work at anything\n",
    "whatsoever, with the stimulus of hope only. He must be bolstered up by certainty, supported\n",
    "by the walls of his groove, else he can do nothing; and if he can not get into his friendly\n",
    "groove, he lets himself drift into destruction. In no manner are limp people to be depended on,\n",
    "their very central quality being fluidity, which is a bad thing to rest on.\"\n",
    "Few people realize how important a part imagination plays in the every-day matters of life. A\n",
    "business man endeavors to give a prospective customer a mental picture of his products, or of\n",
    "what they will do for him. The physician holds before his patient an image of what he will be\n",
    "and can do when well. The politician describes the condition of things as he would bring them\n",
    "about if elected. The public speaker illuminates and illustrates his subject chiefly by means of\n",
    "the imagination. So in every human activity the order is first the mental picture, then the act.\n",
    "Only second in importance to the image-making faculty is that of initiative, or the power of\n",
    "originality. Many business and professional men acknowledge that, had they known what\n",
    "difficulties awaited them, they could not have gone forward so hopefully. But neither had they\n",
    "the courage to turn back once they had put their hand to the plow. The story of almost every\n",
    "successful man would be a recital of uphill work at first, with many obstacles to be met and\n",
    "overcome, disappointments to be bravely borne, new resolutions of determination made at the\n",
    "beginning of each day.\n",
    "There are a thousand imitators to one who can originate. A man who is constantly watching to\n",
    "see what others are doing in order to steal their thunder, is not true to himself nor developing\n",
    "his best faculties. Nothing could be more belittling to one than the inner realization that he is a\n",
    "mere copyist, a make-believe. We should avail ourselves, it is true, of the experience and ideas\n",
    "of others, and frankly acknowledge our indebtedness to them, but we can not rightly call this\n",
    "material our own until we have put it through our mental process and stamped it with our\n",
    "individuality. Let a man take to heart these inspiring words of Emerson: \"Insist on yourself;\n",
    "never imitate. Your own gift you can present every moment with the cumulative force of a\n",
    "whole life's cultivation; but of the adopted talent of another you have only an extemporaneous\n",
    "half possession. That which each can do best, none but the Maker can teach him. No man yet\n",
    "knows what it is, nor can, till that person has exhibited it. Where is the master who could have\n",
    "taught Shakespeare? Where is the master who could have instructed Franklin, or Washington,or Bacon, or Newton? Every great man is unique. The Scipionism of Scipio is precisely that\n",
    "part he could not borrow. Another Shakespeare will never be made by the study of\n",
    "Shakespeare. Do that which is assigned you, and you can not hope too much or dare too\n",
    "much. There is at this moment for you an utterance brave and grand as that of the colossal\n",
    "chisel of Phidias, or trowel of the Egyptians, or the pen of Moses or Dante, but different from\n",
    "all these. Not possibly will the soul, all rich, all eloquent, with thousand-cloven tongue, deign\n",
    "to repeat itself; but if you can hear what these patriarchs say, surely you can reply to them in\n",
    "the same pitch of voice; for the ear and the tongue are two organs of one nature. Abide in the\n",
    "simple and noble regions of thy life, obey thy heart and thou shalt reproduce the foreworld\n",
    "again.''\n",
    "When Shakespeare says, \"To thine own self be true,\" he indicates the way to originality. Let a\n",
    "man first place in the gallery of his imagination only such pictures as he would care to see\n",
    "materialized in his life. Then let him go bravely forth, resolved to make these a living reality,\n",
    "and by dint of originality, initiative, and courage, wins an enduring place among successful\n",

    "POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE THOUGHT\n",
    "Precisely what does positive thinking mean? It means habitually to dwell upon the pleasant side\n",
    "of things, to see the good in others, and to encourage only thoughts that are helpful and\n",
    "constructive. Positive thought is aggressive in character, expressing itself in the real and\n",
    "substantial, as opposed to negative thought that seeks rather the disagreeable and destructive.\n",
    "The difference between men of these two types is as great as the opposite poles.\n",
    "Let us illustrate this with a concrete example. A man of negative disposition begins the day in\n",
    "an unpleasant frame of mind. He is irritable, ill-natured, and the scowl on his face betokens a\n",
    "cloudy day. The first person who happens to run into him receives a look he is not likely soon\n",
    "to forget. The street-car conductor takes him a block past his office, and is openly\n",
    "reprimanded. Our crusty friend reaches his place of business, forgets to say \"good-morning\" to\n",
    "the office-boy, and plunges discontentedly into the work of the day. Everything goes wrong.\n",
    "The bookkeeper is stupid, the stenographer careless and inaccurate, and the office-boy slow.\n",
    "Orders haven't come in as they should, money is hard to collect, and the business is going to\n",
    "the dogs. The man goes to lunch, eats hurriedly, snaps at the waiter, and leaves his umbrella\n",
    "behind him. Back at the office again he resumes his grumbling, his unhappy mood\n",
    "communicates itself to every one around him, and the day is set down as a black Friday. When\n",
    "he reaches home that night, he is tired, discouraged, crotchety, and more irritable than ever.\n",
    "Such is the insidious and destructive power of negative thinking.\n",
    "But here is another man who awakens with noble aspirations blossoming in his mind. He is\n",
    "grateful for the blue sky overhead and for the birds singing in the trees. He reflects their music\n",
    "in his ringing \"good-morning,\" and as he steps out into the clear, invigorating air he determines\n",
    "to see only the best in all around him. His attitude of mind is positive, strong, and constructive.\n",
    "He goes forward under good auspices, for hope and enthusiasm are a force of constant\n",
    "attraction. There is no dawdling, doubt, hesitation, fear of any kind. He is confident, upright,\n",
    "and optimistic. The strong and unwavering faith he has in himself others soon come to have in\n",
    "him. He enters upon every undertaking with the most positive assurance and self-reliance. The\n",
    "great and mighty force of his persistent thinking makes his life what it is, and his friends write\n",
    "him down a successful man. The greatest force in the world to-day for developing personality\n",
    "is auto-suggestion. There is practically no limit to which a man may build both his mental and\n",
    "spiritual powers through the application of suggestions from himself to himself. The\n",
    "psychologists may be trusted to work out the question of whether there are two minds in man,\n",
    "the conscious and subconscious, but we know that the ego, the \"I,\" the soul, call it what you\n",
    "wish, is constantly at work within us and constantly suggesting to our outward working mind\n",
    "what it should or should not do, all the while making for good or evil, success or failure.\n",
    "Can we control this thought of ours? We can. To illustrate: You are reading a book and\n",
    "suddenly discover that, while your eyes have been following the printed page, your mind has\n",
    "wandered far and distant. Then you bring back your mind, so to speak, put it upon the printed\n",
    "page, and again you read. What was it that discovered your mind wandering away and gently\n",
    "led it back? If you can direct your mind in this way to the thoughts of a book, you can as\n",
    "readily apply it to any other sources you choose. The working mind, then, is a machine, and\n",
    "working along positive lines and for positive ends, it moves in harmony and imparts to the\n",
    "owner a sense of satisfaction and confidence.\n",

    "THE SPEAKING VOICE\n",
    "There are still many persons who think of the speaking voice as an endowment of nature, and\n",
    "that all attempts to cultivate it are worthless and superfluous. The specious excuse is offered\n",
    "that conscious training leads to artificiality. The consequence is that, instead of hearing\n",
    "full-toned, melodious speaking voices, we are subjected on every side to instruments that are\n",
    "nasal, high-pitched, discordant, or otherwise disagreeable.\n",
    "It is surprising that intelligent men should be satisfied to express their thoughts and feelings by\n",
    "means of an untrained and totally inadequate vehicle. A great violinist must have a\n",
    "Stradivarius, a pianist a Steinway, and even the ordinary workman demands the best tools for\n",
    "his particular trade. Why, then, should a man neglect to train his voice, the most wonderful\n",
    "instrument of all, and to make it responsive to his varied thought and emotion?\n",
    "It is said that a well-modulated voice testifies to a strain of good blood in the speaker's\n",
    "ancestry. It is the most distinguishing mark of a refined and cultivated mind. The instant the\n",
    "tone of a man's voice is heard he is estimated, set down, and thereafter known by that first\n",
    "involuntary proclamation. The voice is one of the greatest revealers of a man's inmost nature.\n",
    "There you may observe his strength or weakness of character, the peculiarities of his\n",
    "temperament, the lack or possession of self-confidence, and the hundred-and-one disclosures\n",
    "of mind and heart.\n",
    "The first thing for one to learn to do is to use the voice without strain. The throat should have\n",
    "free play, and all effort should be made at the abdominal muscles. The tone should be low\n",
    "rather than high, and soft rather than loud. Especially should a speaker learn to speak in tune.\n",
    "That is to say, he should know how to adapt his voice to the subject and the occasion. For\n",
    "ordinary conversation a moderate volume is most desirable, but in public speaking larger\n",
    "treatment is necessary.\n",
    "The student of self-confidence should accustom himself to speak in slow, easy, deliberate\n",
    "tones. This will not only enable him to keep better control of his powers, but will make a more\n",
    "favorable impression upon others. A distinct enunciation has an important bearing upon the\n",
    "speaking voice, bringing out more completely its qualities of purity and resonance. The student\n",
    "should listen carefully to his own voice and check undesirable tendencies. The common faults\n",
    "of nasality, throatiness, and speaking through half-closed lips, are unconsciously acquired, and\n",
    "these and like faults of speech should be constantly guarded against.\n",
    "A most excellent way to train the voice is to read aloud for a few minutes daily. It may be an\n",
    "extract from an English stylist, or part of a great poem. If a man feels sensitive about practicing\n",
    "before others, he may read aloud from his newspaper, in this way getting actual vocal practice\n",
    "while at the same time interesting those who may listen to him. Time spent in cultivating the\n",
    "voice will be amply repaid. One who is thoroughly in earnest will be able to find the time for\n",
    "practice. It is detrimental to a good speaking voice to talk when under nervous excitement. In\n",
    "our large cities it is often a contest between a person's voice and noise of the street to see\n",
    "which can best be heard. The noise in the street is usually victorious. This develops in a\n",
    "speaker sharpness and hardness of tone, and unnaturalness in the speaking style. Elapid speech\n",
    "and high pitch are wearing alike to speaker and hearer. The voice is an instrument of delicate\n",
    "and wonderful adjustment, and although it will sometimes stand abuse for a while, it will\n",
    "sooner or later rebel against ill treatment.Energy of thought should manifest it-self not in loudness but in intensity of voice. If a man put\n",
    "the proper earnestness into his utterances, naturalness and reality will necessarily follow. The\n",
    "voice must be colored from within, so that the vividness and intensity with which the speaker\n",
    "himself sees and feels will be communicated to others. In connection with this subject, one may\n",
    "be reminded that the mouth is capable of infinite degrees of expression, Delsarte placing its\n",
    "variations at over 2,000.\n",
    "In every good speaking voice there should be sympathy, or heart-force. This produces geniality\n",
    "and frankness in the speaker which instantly commend him to the listener. He seems to take the\n",
    "hearer into his confidence, speaking to him as man to man, and impressing him with the force\n",
    "and conviction of what he says. A well-trained voice imparts satisfaction to the man himself,\n",
    "and gives him a self-confidence he might not otherwise possess.\n",
    "When a man attempts to speak in public, especially for the first time, what startles him most is\n",
    "the strange and inadequate effect of his own voice. If it has not been trained, he realizes his\n",
    "deficiency and at once becomes self-conscious and uncomfortable. It is a sad commentary\n",
    "upon a grown man that he can not speak loud enough to be heard at the end of a large hall. He\n",
    "mumbles, and whispers, and pipes his tones, but all to no purpose. Cries of \"louder\" only\n",
    "embarrass him the more, and at last perchance he must sit down covered with confusion.\n",
    "The whisper of William Pitt, the younger, could be heard in the most remote parts of the\n",
    "House of Commons. It is said that, at the age of twenty-one, his wonderful speaking voice\n",
    "really ruled the British nation. All the great English orators developed their voices to the\n",
    "highest efficiency. Many a man, credited with great natural ability in this respect, has privately\n",
    "and patiently trained his voice through practice. Webster's voice was so full and resonant in\n",
    "quality that it would ring in the hearer's ear long after the actual sounds had died away. On one\n",
    "occasion he uttered a phrase with such power of voice that several of his nearest auditors were\n",
    "observed to half rise from their seats.\n",
    "For purposes of public speaking a voice must be of wide range and flexibility. The student is\n",
    "recommended to \"try all methods, from the sledge-hammer to the puff-ball. Be as gentle as a\n",
    "zephyr, and as furious as a tornado. Be, indeed, just what every common sense person is, in his\n",
    "speech, when he talks naturally, pleads vehemently, whispers confidentially, appeals plaintively,\n",
    "or publishes distinctly. Alter the key frequently, and vary the strain constantly. And so, let the\n",
    "bass, the treble, and the tenor take their turn.\" It is difficult to atone for a poor voice in a\n",
    "public speaker. An unfavorable impression once made will not be effaced sometimes even by\n",
    "the most superior mental endowments.\n",
    "Next in importance we name the element of sympathy, which lends a peculiar charm to the\n",
    "speaking voice. This quality more than any other reaches the minds and hearts of men. We like\n",
    "to be able to say of a speaker: \"There is a man who knows and understands me; he has a\n",
    "message for me, perhaps; I will listen to him.\" A well-trained voice should be capable of\n",
    "expressing the entire gamut of human emotions, since men are often reached through the heart\n",
    "and imagination when all other means fail. \"Not a heart,\" says Amiel, \"but has its romance; not\n",
    "a life which does not hide a secret which is either its thorn or its spur. Everywhere is grief,\n",
    "hope, comedy, tragedy; even under the petrifactions of old age, as in the twisted forms of\n",
    "fossils, we may discover the agitations and tortures of youth. This thought is the magic wand\n",
    "of poets and preachers.\" This sympathy can be cultivated by intimate touch with human\n",
    "suffering, by sincere and heartfelt interest in the welfare of others. It is an emanation of the\n",
    "heart, by which the speaker is himself moved before he attempts to influence others.Combined with authority and sympathy, the voice should be trained for adequate expression.\n",
    "The demands upon it may be great and varied, ranging from gentle conversation to vociferous\n",
    "appeal. Like a vast cathedral organ, it must be responsive to every touch of the master--now\n",
    "light as a tinkling bell, then deep as the cannon's roar; here sweet as the shepherd's flute, there\n",
    "shrill as the trumpet's blast; rising and falling, receding and swelling, heaving higher and still\n",
    "higher with its \"thrilling thunders, compressing air into music, and rolling it forth upon the\n",
    "soul.\" Then, as Washington Irving speaks of the organ, \"What long-drawn cadences! What\n",
    "solemn sweeping concords! It grows more and more dense and powerful, it fills the vast pile,\n",
    "and seems to jar the very walls, the ear is stunned, the senses are overwhelmed. And now it is\n",
    "winding up in full jubilee; it is rising from earth to heaven; the very soul seems wrapped away\n",
    "and floating upward on this swelling tide of harmony.\" Such is the wonderful power of the\n",
    "human voice, and it should be every man's richest possession."

    "CONFIDENCE IN BUSINESS\n",
    "There is something in the bearing of a successful man that instantly proclaims itself. If you will\n",
    "closely observe him you will be particularly impressed by his speech and manner. He carries\n",
    "himself erect, looks you straight in the eye, and speaks in a voice that is direct and\n",
    "authoritative. He is sure of himself, and without apparent effort commands your attention and\n",
    "approval. He is a thinker. His opinions have been thoroughly thought out and formulated into\n",
    "judgments. He has the facts. Hence, he does not quickly resent opposing opinions, knowing he\n",
    "can at will combat and overthrow them. He has poise. This he has learned from his long\n",
    "experience with the world of men. He does not scatter his powers, but concentrates upon one\n",
    "thing at a time. He is master of himself, and therefore easily masters others. He is, in short,\n",
    "what is known as a self-confident man.\n",
    "Self-reliance can be cultivated by persistently affirming the thing which one desires to do and\n",
    "be. The words \"I can and will,\" if repeated earnestly and often enough, should conquer the\n",
    "most formidable difficulties. When a man says, \"I think I will see Smith about this, and perhaps\n",
    "he will do what I want,\" he is not working on successful lines. When, however, he says firmly\n",
    "and positively,'' Smith is the very man for this; I will make him do it,\" the very determination of\n",
    "his purpose multiplies many times his chances of success.\n",
    "The business man who is desirous of developing a high degree of self-confidence, should begin\n",
    "by assuming the physical attitude of the man he would be. His walk should be brisk and\n",
    "elastic, but not hurried. As a special exercise, lie may say mentally, at each step,\n",
    "\"I--am--a--strong--dignified--magnetic--self-confident--man.\" Or he may repeat to him-self, ''\n",
    "I--will--accomplish--this--business--that--I--now--go--to--secure.'' Over and over again he\n",
    "should say, \"I--am--vigorous--strong--successful---and self-confident.\n",
    "I--grow--daily--in--ambition-- power---influence--cheerfulness and achievement.\"\n",
    "When the head of a business is self-confident, he silently communicates this quality to his\n",
    "employees. They in turn inspire the same feeling in their customers, so that the entire\n",
    "atmosphere of such a house becomes one of trust and respect. The structure of the whole\n",
    "business world, indeed, has its foundation in mutual confidence.\n",
    "Politeness is one of the most valuable assets in business. The principal of a corporation recently\n",
    "sent a telegram to each of its thousands of employees, asking, \"Did you say 'thank you' to\n",
    "every customer you waited on to-day?\" It is a mistake to think of courtesy as weakness or\n",
    "servility. The strongest and most valiant men have been noteworthy for this high quality.\n",
    "Scores of instances in business and professional life might be cited where pleasing manners\n",
    "have won fortune and fame.\n",
    "In business, as in society, a man's personal appearance counts for much. His clothes, linen,\n",
    "shoes, the care of his teeth, nails, and hair, all contribute to his feeling of self-respect and to the\n",
    "impression he makes upon others. A smart-looking suit, polished shoes, and clean-shaven face,\n",
    "have sometimes taken precedence over ability. In most business houses a shabbily-dressed man\n",
    "will not be employed, however talented he may be. A good personal appearance is as\n",
    "indispensable to success as it is to self-confidence. For this reason it is vitally important that a\n",
    "man keep himself in prime physical condition. Fresh skin, clear eyes, favorable and vigorous\n",
    "manner are indications of personal character.An attractive force in business is that of cheerful thinking. Some men are always complaining\n",
    "that business is bad, or not what it used to be. They cast a gloomy shadow over every one they\n",
    "meet, gradually driving people away until at length their business slips entirely from them. A\n",
    "cheerful man is an attractive force. People like to meet him and will choose to return to him\n",
    "again and again. It is the cheerful man in business who knows how to face disappointments,\n",
    "adjust difficulties, and turn hostility into friendship. A sunny smile will often disarm the most\n",
    "disgruntled customer, and a pleasant remark may conciliate an enemy. It is well known that\n",
    "cheerful-faced clerks report the largest cash sales at the close of the day. An optimistic,\n",
    "cheerful, self-confident temperament is too valuable a business asset to be disregarded, and,\n",
    "more over, no great success is possible without it.\n",
    "Properly to conduct a large business in these days of keen competition one must possess many\n",
    "varied abilities. Energy, judgment, decision, invincible determination, self-reliance, and similar\n",
    "qualities are essential. As a writer says: \"The perpetual call on a man's readiness, self-control,\n",
    "and vigor which business makes, the constant appeals to the intellect, the stress upon the will,\n",
    "the necessity for rapid and responsible exercise of judgment--all these constitute high culture,\n",
    "though not the highest. It is a culture which strengthens and invigorates, if it does not refine;\n",
    "which gives force, if not polish. It makes strong men, and ready men, and men of vast capacity\n",
    "for affairs, though it does not necessarily make refined men or gentlemen.'' But we know that a\n",
    "business man can be and often is a high type of gentleman. Kindness, frankness, courtesy, and\n",
    "all the polished manners of refined society, may be carried into the counting room.\n",
    "System and regularity in business are conducive to self-confidence. Poise and tranquility of\n",
    "mind are not possible where things are topsy-turvy. A definite time and place for everything\n",
    "exercises a surprising effect upon a man's good nature. When soldiers are on the march, it is\n",
    "necessary for those in front to move forward in regular order, else those in the rear will be\n",
    "thrown into confusion. So in business, when a man makes it a rule to dispose of his routine\n",
    "matters promptly and thoroughly he is able to begin each day with a clear mind and free from\n",
    "undue anxiety. It is amazing how some busy men of affairs transact their daily business without\n",
    "haste or friction, and all because of well-organized system. Promptitude is a quality that\n",
    "inspires confidence in a man. To be on time is an aid to self-possession. One who is late in\n",
    "rising, late in reaching the office, late for lunch, late for engagements, works at a constant\n",
    "disadvantage, and it is small wonder that such a man soon loses faith in himself. Grant has been\n",
    "compared to Napoleon in his punctuality and scrupulous attention to details. Sherman once\n",
    "wrote to him, saying: \"You went into battle as if the event of possible defeat had never for a\n",
    "moment entered your thought. I can compare it to nothing but to the faith of a Christian in his\n",
    "Savior. It was this that gave us confidence.\" Real courage is infectious. The bright,\n",
    "enthusiastic, independent man infuses these same qualities in those about him. He creates an\n",
    "atmosphere of success so that others are eager for association with him. Nothing succeeds like\n",
    "success. The crowd follows the leader. Once a business man is prosperous, he has no difficulty\n",
    "in securing patrons. To the lawyer of large practice, the specialist with a \"waiting list,\" and the\n",
    "minister with a well-filled church, all are anxious to go.\n",
    "A business man should be a good judge of human nature, know how to adapt himself quickly\n",
    "to unexpected circumstances, know precisely when to argue and when merely to suggest.\n",
    "Arrogance and dogmatism should never be confounded with self-reliance. A disposition to\n",
    "yield, when judgment dictates the wisdom of such a course, is an element in the confidence we\n",
    "have been recommending in these pages.\n",
    "Who is most rapidly promoted in a business house? Not the timid, apologetic, humble man\n",
    "who is afraid to suggest, initiate, or speak out for himself. It is he who pushes ahead whileothers contentedly remain in the rut, and who, striving to make the most of himself, determines\n",
    "that to-day will be better than yesterday, and who speaks forth his innermost convictions with\n",
    "unwavering courage. It is this efficient, independent, self-reliant man who is in constant and\n",
    "increasing demand, and who at last becomes indispensable.\n",

    "CONFIDENCE IN SOCIETY\n",
    "Men who live much in solitude are often surprised to find themselves awkward and\n",
    "embarrassed when obliged to enter society. This is particularly noticeable in literary celebrities\n",
    "who perchance forsake their study and books for some social or public function at which they\n",
    "are expected to speak. But the rule applies here as to everything else, that only through\n",
    "practice and familiarity does one acquire ease, grace, and self-confidence.\n",
    "At first the painter holds his brush with fear and trembling, because of conscious lack of skill.\n",
    "The musician, too, finds his fingers cold and inflexible, for want of training and skill in\n",
    "technique. The student of dancing is awkward and self-conscious while he attempts to imitate\n",
    "the steps of the master. Even the public speaker owes his first embarrassment not to lack of\n",
    "brains and ability, but simply to insufficient practice.\n",
    "The first thing, therefore, for a man to do to gain self-confidence in society is to move as much\n",
    "as possible among people. He must become one of them, enter into their interests and foibles,\n",
    "be capable of indulging in \"small talk\" on occasion, and above all know how to be a good\n",
    "listener. By this we mean he should be able to become absorbed in what another is saying,\n",
    "even tho he wish himself elsewhere. Adaptability is the handmaiden of ability in society. If\n",
    "some one tells a story one has heard before, he will not say \"I have always enjoyed that so\n",
    "much!\" but will laugh heartily over it as if for the first time.\n",
    "A careful speaker will not accompany his remarks by such expressions as \"Don't you know?\"\n",
    "\"Listen!\" \"You see?\" \"Look here!\" \"Say!\" and other common tricks of speech. If he can not\n",
    "hold the attention of the hearer it is time for him to change his subject or his delivery.\n",
    "Moreover, it is irritating to most persons to be reminded of their inattention and lack of\n",
    "interest. Nor should the listener interject such expressions as \"Really!\" \"You don't say so!\"\n",
    "\"Indeed!\" and \"I declare!\" These are objectionable to the speaker, and hinder rather than help\n",
    "him.\n",
    "There are many men who speak well and fluently to one person at a time, but in the company\n",
    "of many are stricken suddenly dumb and helpless. Their self-consciousness is super induced by\n",
    "a false idea that all eyes are upon them, and that they must necessarily appear to disadvantage.\n",
    "This super sensitiveness sometimes leads to many kinds of foolish fear, rendering the victim\n",
    "awkward and artificial. To this class belongs the blush-persecuted man who mistakenly thinks\n",
    "he is the subject of constant and critical examination. His mind is so completely absorbed in\n",
    "himself that he has no thought for anything else; consequently he blunders, apologizes, and\n",
    "generally misconducts himself.\n",
    "Be well groomed that you may feel self-confident in your dress and appearance. No man can\n",
    "feel entirely at his ease when he knows he is not attired as he should be. Clothes do not make\n",
    "the man, it is true, but they play an important part in the impression he makes upon others.\n",
    "Dress is an expression of a person's taste and individuality. A well-fitting suit of clothes may\n",
    "testify to care and good judgment in other matters.\n",
    "A famous inscription on some ancient gates read on the first gate, \"Be bold!\" on the second\n",
    "gate, \"Be bold, be bold, and evermore be bold!\" on the third gate, \"Be not too bold!\" Likewise\n",
    "in entering the gates of society, one should be self-confident, but not too much so. There is\n",
    "much to learn and observe. There are rights and limitations to be respected. One of the mostfatal things is familiarity, which is well said \"to breed contempt.\" One should take warning\n",
    "from the lines of Cowper wherein he speaks on friendship:\n",
    "The man that hails you Tom or Jack, And proves, by thumping on your back, His sense of your\n",
    "great merit, Is such a friend that one had need Be very much his friend indeed To pardon, or to\n",
    "bear it.\n",
    "Inquisitiveness may easily become impertinence. Sarcasm should be used seldom, if at all. It is\n",
    "a dangerous weapon, and sometimes cuts like a two-edged sword. Slang does not lend grace\n",
    "and refinement to speech. Wit and humor should be used sparingly, lest it set a man down as\n",
    "superficial. Bluntness that seems to say, \"Who was your father?\" before you have been fairly\n",
    "introduced, is a mark of ill-breeding. These and many other little things are worthy of care\n",
    "from one who essays to bear himself self-confidently before others.\n",
    "In society one must talk upon a great variety of subjects. A man should, therefore, have a sort\n",
    "of \"current-events\" education. His newspaper and magazine will give him information upon\n",
    "topics of the day, and these may be supplemented with special books and reviews.\n",
    "Society is the schoolhouse of good manners. We recognize the breeding of a man first, and his\n",
    "abilities afterward. Intimate association with one's fellow men develops courtesy and\n",
    "magnanimity.\n",
    "\"How sweet and gracious, even in common speech, Is that fine sense which men call Courtesy!\n",
    "Wholesome as air and genial as the light, Welcome in every clime as breath of flowers, it\n",
    "transmutes aliens into trusting friends, and gives its owner passport round the globe.\"\n",
    "Unfailing courtesy teaches a man to say the right word and to do the right thing. This is the\n",
    "politeness that has been called \"benevolence in little things.\" Emerson says: '' There are certain\n",
    "manners which are learned in good society, of that force, that, if a person have them, he or she\n",
    "must be considered, and is everywhere welcome, though without beauty, or wealth, or genius.\"\n",
    "It is society that teaches a man the art of pleasing, which\n",
    "Chesterfield said was the art of rising, of distinguishing one's self, of making a figure and a\n",
    "fortune in the world. A sincere speaker may pay a delicate compliment without descending to\n",
    "flattery. A word of well-deserved praise is always acceptable, and makes a man forever\n",
    "welcome in the society of good people. Politics and theology are not safe subjects for easy\n",
    "conversation. A contradictory man is usually counted a bore and a nuisance. You perhaps\n",
    "venture the opinion that it will rain, but he tells you firmly he doesn't think so. Again, there is\n",
    "the arrogant man, whose word is law, and who resents the slightest opposition. When he stalks\n",
    "forth, the only thing to do is to subside into silence and let him stalk and talk.\n",
    "The man with the too long story will be made uncomfortable in intelligent society. An English\n",
    "writer, in speaking of London society, says pointedly: \"Topics are treated lightly and, above\n",
    "all, briefly. If you want to preach a sermon, you must get into a pulpit or a newspaper; preach\n",
    "it at table you can not. You may tell a story, but you must, in Hayward's phrase, cut it to the\n",
    "bone. If you do not cut it short, you will be cut into and before you are half-way through;\n",
    "another man will have begun and finished his, and your audience will have gone over to the\n",
    "enemy.\" When a man is known for too long storytelling he is regarded as insufferable and is\n",
    "generally avoided.\n",
    "The experience of Lord Chesterfield should encourage any man desirous of becoming\n",
    "self-confident in society. At first he was exceedingly awkward and almost frightened \"out ofhis wits.\" He bowed obsequiously; thought himself beneath others, suspected every whisper\n",
    "was about him and his particular defects. But he persevered, through many and seemingly\n",
    "insurmountable difficulties, and became, as all know, the most polished gentleman of his day.\n",
    "But with all one's superiority the basis must ever lie in simplicity. The test of a truly great man\n",
    "is his humility. An English woman of keen observation says: \"I have never yet come across a\n",
    "person really far above the average, either mentally or morally, who ever became too big for\n",
    "his boots or his Bible.\" Self-assertion should never be substituted for self-confidence. No one\n",
    "cares to listen long to a man clothed in infallibility, or who prates much about himself. When\n",
    "Charles Kingsley was asked what were his favorite topics of conversation, he answered,\n",
    "\"Whatever my companion happens to be talking about.\" A man should be ready for\n",
    "self-effacement, whenever that may be necessary. It is the unpretentious man that most easily\n",
    "wins favor.\n",
    "A bashful man should purposely seek the society of women. Their refining influence will tend\n",
    "to bring out the best that is in him, to polish off the rough places, and to lift him to higher\n",
    "ideals. Many of the world's greatest men have testified to their indebtedness to women, not\n",
    "only for practical help, but for those higher spiritual qualities that transform men into heroes.\n",
    "No man should live unto himself. Silence and solitude if long protracted have a depressing\n",
    "effect upon all the noblest elements in a man.\n",
    "Let a man, then, go into society with lofty spirit and magnanimous bearing, and these qualities\n",
    "will be reflected back to him. Too high-minded for petty things, he will see the best in others\n",
    "and they will see the best in him. Finally, let him carry in his heart the inspiring song of Lowell:\n",
    "'' Be noble! and the nobleness that lies in other men, sleeping, but never dead, will rise in\n",
    "majesty to meet thine own.\""

    "CONFIDENCE IN PUBLIC SPEAKING\n",
    "The one thing needful in the development of self-confidence in public speaking is practice. In\n",
    "all first efforts, whether it be to swim, write, skate, or dance, we have crudeness, uncertainty,\n",
    "and limitations. The beginner in public speaking is on unfamiliar ground, and he can not help\n",
    "being self-conscious. This is a necessary part of his development. There can be no proper\n",
    "freedom in what he is saying so long as he has to think of how he is saying it. His first efforts\n",
    "should, for this reason, be simple. A few ideas, plainly spoken, are all he need here attempt.\n",
    "After he has gained some facility and self-reliance, he may, like the swimmer, venture into\n",
    "deeper water.\n",
    "Let us assume that the reader of these pages is afflicted with an extreme form of fear and\n",
    "diffidence in attempting even this simple first effort. He may belong to that class described as\n",
    "\"trembling at the knees,\" or \"glued to the chair,\" when invited to address an audience. In short,\n",
    "what is a man to do if he can not bring himself to the point of facing an audience at all?\n",
    "In such case he must begin by declaiming his speeches in the privacy of his room. He must\n",
    "become accustomed to \"hearing himself talk.\" These speeches may be his own, or selected\n",
    "models of others, but they are to be rendered aloud, while standing before a looking-glass,\n",
    "with suitable voice and gesture. He may imagine an audience before him, and speak as directly\n",
    "and earnestly as he would were they actually present. Next, he may invite a member of his\n",
    "family, or a friend, to listen to him. Gradually but surely he will find himself gaining in\n",
    "assurance, and at the proper time he will be ready for his \"maiden effort\" in public. No matter\n",
    "how slow the process may be, the ultimate results are certain.\n",
    "Another excellent preparation for self-confidence in speaking is that of telling stories. We need\n",
    "hardly remind the reader that these stories should be as new as possible, have good points, and\n",
    "be told in an interesting manner. The speaker must concentrate his mind upon the story and\n",
    "really relish telling it, so that he will be sharing a pleasure with others. Here again he may begin\n",
    "with the members of his own family, who will be lenient with him if these first efforts are not\n",
    "wholly effective. Story-telling is not a difficult art, but consists chiefly of two things: Getting a\n",
    "good fund of stories, and telling them without self-consciousness. A few short recitations,\n",
    "thoroughly memorized, may also be used as a means of accustoming the student to facing an\n",
    "audience. It may here be repeated that a frequent cause of timidity is a lack of proper\n",
    "knowledge of the subject. An audience becomes severely critical when a speaker appears not\n",
    "to have an adequate grasp of the facts. They will overlook his diffidence, setting it down to\n",
    "modesty, but they will not overlook palpable weakness and uncertainty in the subject-matter. A\n",
    "man who has the facts may readily be forgiven for lack of ability in presenting them, but one\n",
    "who stands to speak before others without proper knowledge of his subject is justly regarded\n",
    "as a pretender.\n",
    "To become thoroughly self-confident a man should believe in his own ideas, live them, and\n",
    "advocate them with earnestness and conviction. He will be steadied by the consciousness of\n",
    "being in the right. All of which means that every man should spare no pains to ascertain the\n",
    "facts bearing upon his subject before attempting to give them to others. Getting the facts is the\n",
    "very foundation of self-confidence in speaking. We all know of men who boldly proclaim ideas\n",
    "of which they really are not certain, and then because of a slight contradiction suffer instant\n",
    "defeat and humiliation.Next to having a solid foundation of facts, the speaker should know how to present them\n",
    "interestingly and effectively. He can not hope to do this without developing his powers of\n",
    "expression. A man, for example, who has no control of the pitch of his voice, but permits his\n",
    "earnestness to carry him into a high key or unduly loud tone, will not convince intelligent men\n",
    "as he should. Indistinctness of enunciation, a common fault with timid speakers, will tell\n",
    "seriously against him, since men grow inattentive if obliged long to strain themselves to hear.\n",
    "Un- gracefulness and violence of gesture will detract from the impression made by the speaker.\n",
    "In fact, any shortcoming in delivery, however slight, will have its share in producing an adverse\n",
    "effect.\n",
    "Sometimes this nervousness in a public speaker, even in the case of experienced men, is due to\n",
    "over-anxiety. He wishes his speech to make a good impression, or his cause to succeed, or a\n",
    "sense of personal responsibility oppresses him. All these seem legitimate in themselves, but a\n",
    "sensible man should know that undue anxiety will possibly defeat the very purpose he has in\n",
    "view. When a man is over-anxious he is not at his best nor can he be. He lacks freedom and\n",
    "flexibility, and his real self is for the time in subjection. His mind is divided between his subject\n",
    "and the impression he is making, self- consciousness is inevitable, and his fear silently but\n",
    "surely communicates itself to the audience.\n",
    "A slight nervousness at the beginning of a speech may act in favor of a speaker by enlisting the\n",
    "sympathy and good-will of his hearers, but he must be able to rise above this feeling as he\n",
    "enters into his subject, else he will fail to carry conviction. When Gladstone was asked if he\n",
    "was ever nervous in public speaking he said, \"In opening a subject, often; in reply, never.\" The\n",
    "assumption is that once a speaker is well started, he no longer thinks of himself, but pours into\n",
    "his delivery all the power, intensity, and courage that his subject demands.\n",
    "The nervousness of many men in addressing an audience is due to lack of proper elocutionary\n",
    "training. They have no knowledge of the speaking voice and its use, no facility of musical\n",
    "expression, and no idea of what to do with their hands and arms. They do not come to realize\n",
    "the importance of this training until they have actually tested themselves before an audience.\n",
    "Then, perhaps, it dawns upon them that the art of speaking, like any other art, must be\n",
    "developed through study and practice.\n",
    "A writer says, \"My subject is not elocution, or emphasis, or dramatic reading, or gesticulation,\n",
    "but public speaking.'' He forgets that he can not properly consider one without the other. The\n",
    "public speaker is deeply concerned with all the elements of elocution--of inflection, emphasis,\n",
    "pausing--and he can not be a good speaker if he disregard any one of these. In this study there\n",
    "must, of course, be taste and judgment. A man's elocution, although important, is not to be\n",
    "prominent. Proper expression will not attract attention to itself. The purpose of the study of\n",
    "elocution is ultimately so to free the speaker's mind that he can safely abandon himself to\n",
    "spontaneous expression. This knowledge of technique is an essential part of all art. The\n",
    "painter, musician, sculptor, architect, writer, no less than the orator, must at first be conscious\n",
    "of the principles that underlie his work, since it is this knowledge that finally gives him perfect\n",
    "freedom.\n",
    "A large working vocabulary is a valuable aid to self-confidence. The speaker is not hampered\n",
    "by lack of the right word, nor is he embarrassed by poverty of language. Should his memory\n",
    "fail regarding one set of words, he promptly brings forward others to take their places. One of\n",
    "the best ways to amass a fund of such words is to read aloud daily two or more pages from\n",
    "some master stylist, and carefully note his use of language. Beading aloud gives the additional\n",
    "advantage of hearing the words, and by fitting them to the mouth imparts to the organs ofarticulation both familiarity and flexibility.\n",
    "The voice receives much of its quality from the lips, tongue, palate and throat. If these are\n",
    "held rigidly, the voice will be of like character. In very earnest argumentation the speaker\n",
    "should be cautious about contracting the muscles of the mouth and throat. This is the time to\n",
    "be particularly careful to give the vocal apparatus its greatest possible freedom, and to keep\n",
    "the key of the voice low. The speaker may be intense, but not loud; he may enforce, but not\n",
    "threaten; and, above all, his voice should accompany, not lead, his argument.\n",
    "There are times when a speaker must express himself with unusual feeling. The power of the\n",
    "mind and the earnestness of the speaker will project themselves into his eyes, mouth, voice,\n",
    "gesture, perhaps into a single finger, and this passion made so manifest will the more likely\n",
    "become aroused in the hearer. But in whatever manner his subject may require him to speak,\n",
    "he must not violate elocutionary canons, but do all with becoming grace and skill. Cicero's\n",
    "advice to the student may be followed to advantage:\n",
    "\"The qualities that attract favor to the orator are a soft tone of voice, a countenance expressive\n",
    "of modesty, a mild manner of speaking; so that if he attacks any one with severity, he may be\n",
    "seen to do so unwillingly and from compulsion. It is of peculiar advantage that indications of\n",
    "good nature, of liberality, of gentleness, of piety, of grateful feelings, free from selfishness and\n",
    "avarice, should appear in him; and everything that characterizes men of probity and humility,\n",
    "not acrimonious, nor pertinacious, nor litigious, nor harsh, very much conciliates benevolence,\n",
    "and alienates the affections from those in whom such qualities are not apparent. The contrary\n",
    "qualities to these, therefore, are to be imputed to your opponents. This mode of address is\n",
    "extremely excellent in those causes in which the mind of the judge can not well be inflamed by\n",
    "ardent and vehement incitation; for energetic oratory is not always desirable, but often smooth,\n",
    "submissive, gentle language, which gains much favor for the defendants, a term by which I\n",
    "designate not only such as are accused, but all persons about whose affairs there is any\n",
    "litigation; for in that sense people formerly used the word.\"\n",
    "It can not be too often repeated that the style of one's every-day conversation will largely\n",
    "determine what his public speaking will be. Here a speaker should form his best habits both of\n",
    "thought and expression. He should speak in the style he would employ when he speaks in\n",
    "public. He can state his arguments as clearly and precisely to one as he would to five hundred.\n",
    "It is true that, for the larger occasion, he must have larger vocal effects, but this must all be\n",
    "done naturally and symmetrically. A man should cultivate an ear for his own voice. He must\n",
    "know what he is about at all times, and suffer no occasion to permit of slovenly speech. A man\n",
    "makes a series of speeches every day of his life, and these should be the very best preparation\n",
    "for public effort. To be thoroughly self-confident, a man must hold himself superior to his\n",
    "surroundings--not in the sense of pride or self-exaltation, but in the better sense of being\n",
    "superior through knowledge. He must dominate by the force of his strong personality and his\n",
    "thorough grasp of his subject. He must have himself well in hand, and know definitely the\n",
    "object of his speaking. No one has a right to speak in public unless he has something worth\n",
    "while to say. If he has something of the kind to say, let him say it distinctly, deliberately, and\n",
    "earnestly.\n",
    "Deliberateness of speech will save the beginner from many pitfalls. The trouble with a rapid\n",
    "speaker is that he does not take time to breathe properly, pronounce his words distinctly, or to\n",
    "frame his sentences in his mind before giving them expression. All within is a jumble and the\n",
    "outward style follows as a matter of course. The effect of a slow and easy style in speaking is\n",
    "illustrated in a story of Lord Palmerston, who was known always to take his time. While hewas addressing an audience, a member of the audience, as is the custom in England,\n",
    "interrupted him, asking if he would give a plain answer to a plain question. When asked what\n",
    "the question was, the man said, \"Will you vote for such-and-such measure of reform!\" Lord\n",
    "Palmerston very slowly answered, \"I will\"--then. paused long, while some of the audience\n",
    "cheered, and added, \"not,\" while others cheered, and then he said, \"tell you!\" whereupon the\n",
    "whole audience broke forth into hearty and vociferous applause. Haste is not only waste, but\n",
    "means inferiority. A man can not hope to be self-possessed in public speaking unless he is\n",
    "deliberate. A reasonably slow style of speaking gives increased weight to one's words, and\n",
    "gains credit for depth and profundity, not always, however, wholly deserved. But more than\n",
    "this, it gives the speaker time in which properly to formulate his sentences, to observe their\n",
    "effect upon the audience, and to express exactly what he wishes to say. A rapid speaker is\n",
    "forever saying the wrong thing, or something he did not intend, or running off into dreary\n",
    "discursiveness. A deliberate speaker is likely to be more careful and accurate, his words more\n",
    "particularly rounded out into clearness and fullness, and his whole style more emphatic and\n",
    "energetic. He must not drawl, nor give the impression of tardiness, since these, too, are faults\n",
    "to be avoided. The deliberateness of which we speak simply means that he be self-possessed,\n",
    "sincere, and deeply solicitous that everyone should understand him. What has been said must\n",
    "not be confounded with a monotonous delivery. Nothing is more uninteresting than to listen to\n",
    "an unvaried tone of voice, however good the speaker's ideas may be. We are recommending\n",
    "energetic and expressive deliberateness, not drawling monotony or hesitation.\n",
    "THE FOOT-PATH TO PEACE\n",
    "To be glad of life because it gives you the chance to love and to work and to play and to look\n",
    "up at the stars; to be satisfied with your possessions but not contented with yourself until you\n",
    "have made the best of them; to despise nothing in the world except falsehood and meanness,\n",
    "and to fear nothing except cowardice; to be governed by your admirations rather than by your\n",

    "TOWARD THE HEIGHTS\n",
    "When we go forth to do our work with gladness of heart, a higher power seems to lend us its\n",
    "beneficent aid. Work that is cheerfully done is usually well done. The mighty deeds wrought\n",
    "for humanity invariably have sprung from hearts inspired by gladness of life. To be grateful for\n",
    "opportunity to act, to work, to love, and to serve, is one of the supreme joys of earth.\n",

    "forward with blithesome heart song, happy in the consciousness of living here and now.\n",

    "everywhere. Because it enables us to develop all that is best in us and to raise ourselves to\n",
    "empyrean heights. Because it reveals the divinity within us and the glorious destiny just\n",
    "beyond.\n",
    "Several years ago a successful man retired from business, wishing to live a life of ease and\n",
    "comfort. He entered society, and with little to do became a slave to drink. Gradually he grew\n",
    "more unhappy, until illness and discouragement took possession of him. One day he\n",
    "determined again to engage in business, and as a result he is to-day as well and happy as ever.\n",
    "The worst misfortune that can befall a man in this world is enforced idleness. To have nothing\n",
    "to do, no set purpose, no ambition, is as dangerous as it is disintegrating. The record of many\n",
    "rich men's sons living in luxury and ease is a startling testimony to the insidious power of\n",
    "indolence. The will to labor is a greater thing than genius. Perseverance and determination\n",
    "have been the distinguishing marks of all great men. Who can forget Carlyle's heroic will to\n",
    "work when the accident befell his manuscript of the first volume of the \"French Revolution\"?\n",
    "He had lent the precious document to a literary friend, John Stuart Mill, who left it lying\n",
    "carelessly in his room. 'When he wished to return it Mill could not find it. It was then\n",
    "discovered that the maid, seeing it on the floor, had thrown it into the fire. Carlyle's anguish\n",
    "can easily be conceived, for much of his valuable data had been cast aside or destroyed. \"With\n",
    "iron courage he set diligently to work and reproduced the manuscript. He it was who said:\n",
    "\"Blest is the man who has found his work.\"\n",
    "The work we aim to do is an index of our mind. When Leonardo chose the Last Supper for his\n",
    "theme he forthwith proclaimed the quality of his spirit. Not every one is born a genius, but if\n",
    "your work be good and right, what matter if it be great or small? It is the spirit in which we\n",
    "labor that determines the value of what we do. We may learn to sing with Mrs. Browning:\n",
    "Beloved, let us love so well our work shall still be better for our love, and still our love be\n",
    "sweeter for our work!\n",
    "The joy of work is enhanced by occasional periods of relaxation. Every man should have a\"playtime\" daily. It is well to let the mental and physical machinery down at frequent intervals\n",
    "in order that one may return to his labor rejuvenated. There is a world of philosophy in the\n",
    "saying, \"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.\" A man who is merely a machine and\n",
    "money-grubber, who knows not how to play, misses much of the best in life. The railroad\n",
    "magnate who cuts his life in two through overwork, has failed to apply his business astuteness\n",
    "to the important matter of right living.\n",
    "It is possible to take life too seriously and to blunt one's abilities by too constant use of them.\n",
    "The worker, however earnest and ambitious, should not overlook the law of action and\n",
    "reaction which runs through all nature. The flow and ebb of the tide, the rise and fall of the\n",
    "fountain, the alternating of day and night, remind us of this principle of work and play that\n",
    "should characterize a man's life.\n",
    "It is easy to grovel. Men sometimes become so intent upon their work that they lose sight of\n",
    "the wonders all about them. The artist finds it necessary to stand off from his picture every\n",
    "little while in order that he may observe the proper effect of light and shade, of perspective and\n",
    "proportion. When a man turns his thoughts for a time entirely away from his regular work, he\n",
    "returns to it with renewed energy and clearness of vision.\n",
    "It is an inspiration upon a clear night to stand and survey the stars as they seem to sing\n",
    "together. Here is music and mystery to satisfy the longing soul. There is no haste, no\n",
    "confusion, no discord, but a silent symphony of the skies. And the more intently we look the\n",
    "nearer they seem to come, until at length we appear to dwell among them. The lives of many\n",
    "men are like the wonderful stars, pouring down on us, as Phillips Brooks says, \"the calm light\n",
    "of their bright and faithful being, up to which we look, and out of which we gather the deepest\n",
    "calm and courage.\"\n",
    "Men are often possessed by their possessions. A Turkish wrestler, sailing from America toward\n",
    "his home, turned all his money into gold, placed it in a belt, and wrapped it around him for\n",
    "safe-keeping. By some irony of fate, the ship was wrecked, and the weight of the gold carried\n",
    "him more swiftly to his watery grave. When a man's possessions are a burden to him, he is not\n",
    "well off. Not how much, but how good and how useful, should be the criterion from which to\n",
    "judge what a man has. What end does it serve always to be coveting the things that are not\n",
    "ours, while neglecting to use what we have? Is it not better to own a Bible and a Shakespeare\n",
    "that we have read than a whole library of books with uncut leaves? A few years ago a book\n",
    "called \"The Simple Life\" had an immense circulation. It struck a responsive chord in thousands\n",
    "of lives. Men were feeling the strain and the responsibility of over-accumulation, of too many\n",
    "of this world's goods, and this appeal on behalf of simplicity profoundly impressed them.\n",
    "The pursuit of money is still intense. Probably the most difficult and unsatisfactory way to\n",
    "obtain it is to aim at it directly. We know a successful man who seldom thinks of money. His\n",
    "theory is that by devoting his time and energies to good work the financial results will take\n",
    "care of themselves. For over ten years he has persistently followed this plan and not once has\n",
    "he been without an abundance. His joy in his work is incomparably greater than that of the man\n",
    "who is merely money mad. Happy is the man who has found out early in life that the\n",
    "accumulation of money for its own sake is not a worthy ambition.\n",
    "If you have books, read them; if you have friendships, strengthen them; if you have money, use\n",
    "it intelligently; if you have time, spend it wisely; if you have talents, cultivate them. Men often\n",
    "achieve greatness through turning small things to great account. \"Not failure, but low-aim, is\n",
    "crime,\" says Lowell.When a distinguished musician was complimented upon his apparently natural genius, he\n",
    "replied: \"Ah, but you do not know with what difficulty this ease has been acquired.\" Sir Joshua\n",
    "Eeynolds was asked how long it had taken him to paint a certain picture. \"All my life,\" he\n",
    "answered. The man who makes the best of his talent is constantly building reserve power. Such\n",
    "a man was Webster. In the great debate with Hayne, when he was suddenly thrown upon his\n",
    "own resources, he incorporated into his speech material that was prepared long before and had\n",
    "been reposing in his desk. Modesty does not mean weakness and self-effacement. It is one of\n",
    "the supreme qualities of manhood. It dislikes sham and pretense. It is an enemy to all that is\n",
    "unreal. It quickly recognizes truth and sincerity, but is quick to condemn the mean and false.\n",
    "Montaigne said: \"The only thing I fear, is fear.\" The courageous man is at a premium, but the\n",
    "wibbly-wobbly person has always been and ever ill be in disfavor. The world awards its prizes\n",
    "to men of firmness and self-reliance. Fear has forged more chains for men than iron links have\n",
    "ever done. To see the best side of life is more a matter of habit than of heredity. A man has a\n",
    "sense of personal uplift when he shows sincere appreciation toward others. Like mercy, \"it\n",
    "blesseth him that gives, and him that receives.\" A man's world is governed by his likes and\n",
    "dislikes, and what he looks for that he invariably finds. We should be eager to possess the\n",
    "great qualities of mind and heart that lift some men above the common crowd. And if we think\n",
    "as we should of our friends, we shall have no time for bitterness toward our foes.\n",
    "Some one who knows has said that if you would have a friend, be one. Thoreau describes\n",
    "friendship as a plant so delicate that the least unworthiness vitiates it. It is a commingling of\n",
    "sympathy and unselfishness. When Charles Kingsley was asked the secret of his beautiful life\n",
    "he answered: \"I had a friend.\" A great friendship is a priceless possession, and lucky is the man\n",
    "who can claim more than one. Schiller says:\n",
    "If thou hast something, bring thy goods! A fair return be thine! If thou art something, bring thy\n",
    "soul and interchange with mine!\n",
    "I remember as a boy the burning of the Grand Opera House in Toronto, Canada. After\n",
    "witnessing a Shakespearian performance, the audience had dispersed to their homes, when at\n",
    "midnight a cry went through the city \"Fire! Fire! The Opera House is on fire!\" Thousands of\n",
    "people gathered to see the brilliant spectacle. Suddenly the flames burst out afresh, driving the\n",
    "firemen back, and at that moment there appeared at a small window close to the roof two men,\n",
    "and a woman with a babe clasped in her arms. What should they do? No ladder in those days\n",
    "could reach such a height. Below was nothing but a frail wood-shed on which they would be\n",
    "dashed to pieces were they to jump. The great crowd stood dumb and helpless as they watched\n",
    "the blanched and terror-stricken faces in that little window. The flames had now reached so\n",
    "close to them that soon they must jump or perish. There was a moment of breathless anxiety,\n",
    "when men, woman and child fell back from view.\n",
    "Then suddenly a sheet was thrown from the window, and a man followed clinging to it\n",
    "desperately as he fell to the ground. He was carried to the hospital with body bruised and\n",
    "broken, but afterward miraculously recovered. When asked to give an account of his\n",
    "experience, he said he had tried to induce his companions, the janitor and his wife, to jump\n",
    "from the window with him, but they could not bring themselves to do it. He felt, as they did,\n",
    "unable to jump out into open space. He thought he must have something to cling to. Then it\n",
    "occurred to him to throw out the sheet which saved his life.\n",
    "To every man there comes at some time a strong religious intuition that he is dependent upon\n",
    "some higher power, that he must have something to which he can cling. For two thousandyears men have been telling others that there is no one to whom they can cling so well as to\n",
    "Christ. Dr. Van Dyke does not say \"Think once in a while of Christ,\" but counsel s men to\n",
    "\"think of him every day.\" No better substitute has ever yet been found, nothing comparable to\n",
    "Him ever will be.\n",
    "This is the new day of healthful living. A man is no longer content to shut body and soul\n",
    "within four walls. He must have air and sunshine; he must hear the birds, and inhale the\n",
    "perfume of bud and flower. So every man may through gladness, love, work and play, move\n",
    "steadily toward the heights, inspired by courage, kindness and gentleness of heart, thinking\n",
    "every day of the Master, until at last he comes to his own, where all is joy and peace."

    "inseparable from it. Its figure, drawn by painters and by poets, displays, in each feature, a\n",

    "Our strength is measured by our plastic power. From the same materials one man builds\n",
    "palaces, another hovels; one warehouses, another villas; bricks and mortar are mortar and\n",
    "bricks until the architect makes them something else. Thus it is that in the same family, in the\n",

    "fulfilled.--Sir Edwin Arnold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every man has experienced how feelings which end in themselves and do not express\n",

    "\n",
    "Be firm; one constant element of luck is genuine, solid, old Teutonic pluck. Stick to your aim:\n",

    "We are not sent into this world to do anything into which we cannot put our hearts. We have\n",
    "certain work to do for our bread, and that is to be done strenuously; other work to do for our\n",

    "and what is not worth this effort is not to be done at all.--Buskin.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the still air the music lies unheard; in the rough marble beauty hides unseen; to wake the\n",

    "I venture to point out to you what is the best temperament, namely, a combination of the\n",
    "desponding and resolute; or, as I had better express it, of the apprehensive and the resolute.\n",
    "Such is the temperament of great commanders. Secretly, they rely upon nothing and upon\n",
    "nobody. There is such a powerful element of failure in all human affairs, that a shrewd man is\n",
    "always saying to himself, \"What shall I do, if that which I count upon does not come out as I\n",

    "\n",
    "Everything yields before the strong and earnest will. It grows by exercise. It excites confidence\n",
    "in others, while it takes to itself the lead. Difficulties before which mere cleverness fails, and\n",

    "ever! \"This did full many who yet sleep unknown\"--Oh! never, never! Think'st thou perchance\n",
    "that they remain unknown whom thou know'st not? By angel trumps in heaven their praise is\n",

    "I have known instances of men of naturally moderate powers of mind who, by a disinterested\n",
    "love of truth, and their fellow creatures, have gradually risen to no small force and enlargement\n",
