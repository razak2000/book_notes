    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The charm of conversation chiefly depends upon the adaptability of the\n",
    "participants. It is a great accomplishment to be able to enter gently\n",
    "and agreeably into the moods of others, and to give way to them with\n",
    "grace and readiness.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The spirit of conversation is oftentimes more important than the ideas\n",
    "expressed. What we are rather than what we say has the most permanent\n",
    "influence upon those around us. Hence it is that where a group of\n",
    "persons are met together in conversation, it is the inner life of each\n",
    "which silently though none the less surely imparts tone and character to\n",
    "the occasion.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>It requires vigorous self-discipline so to cultivate the feelings of\n",
    "kindness and sympathy that they are always in readiness for use. These\n",
    "qualities are essential to agreeable and profitable intercourse, though\n",
    "comparatively few people possess them.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Burke considered manners of more importance than laws. Sidney Smith\n",
    "described manners as the shadows of virtues. Dean Swift defined manners\n",
    "as the art of putting at ease the people with whom we converse.\n",
    "Chesterfield said manners should adorn knowledge in order to smooth its\n",
    "way through the world. Emerson spoke of manners as composed of petty\n",
    "sacrifices.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>We all recognize that a winning manner is made up of seemingly\n",
    "insignificant courtesies, and of constant little attentions. A person of\n",
    "charming manner is usually free from resentments, inquisitiveness, and\n",
    "moods.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Personality plays a large part in interesting conversation. Precisely\n",
    "the same phraseology expressed by two different persons may make two\n",
    "wholly different impressions, and all because of the difference in the\n",
    "personalities of the speakers.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The daily mental life of a man indelibly impresses itself upon his face,\n",
    "where it can be unmistakably read by others. What a person is, innately\n",
    "and habitually, unconsciously discloses itself in voice, manner, and\n",
    "bearing. The world ultimately appraises a man at his true value.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The best type of talker is slow to express positive opinions, is sparing\n",
    "in criticism, and studiously avoids a tone or word of finality. It has\n",
    "been well said that \"A talker who monopolizes the conversation is by\n",
    "common consent insufferable, and a man who regulates his choice of\n",
    "topics by reference to what interests not his hearers but himself has\n",
    "yet to learn the alphabet of the art. Conversation is like lawn-tennis,\n",
    "and requires alacrity in return at least as much as vigor in service. A\n",
    "happy phrase, an unexpected collocation of words, a habitual precision\n",
    "in the choice of terms, are rare and shining ornaments of conversation,\n",
    "but they do not for an instant supply the place of lively and\n",
    "interesting matter, and an excessive care for them is apt to tell\n",
    "unfavorably on the substance of discourse.\"</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>When Lord Beaconsfield was talking his way into social fame, someone\n",
    "said of him, \"I might as well attempt to gather up the foam of the sea\n",
    "as to convey an idea of the extraordinary language in which he clothed\n",
    "his description. There were at least five words in every sentence that\n",
    "must have been very much astonished at the use they were put to, and yet\n",
    "no others apparently could so well have expressed his idea. He talked\n",
    "like a racehorse approaching the winning-post—every muscle in action,\n",
    "and the utmost energy of expression flung out into every burst.\"</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>We are told that Matthew Arnold combined all the characteristics of good\n",
    "conversation—politeness, vivacity, sympathy, interestedness, geniality,\n",
    "a happy choice of words, and a never-failing humor. When he was once\n",
    "asked what was his favorite topic for conversation, he instantly\n",
    "answered, \"That in which my companion is most interested.\"</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Courtesy, it will be noted, is the fundamental basis of good\n",
    "conversation. We must show habitual consideration and kindliness towards\n",
    "others if we would attract them to us. Bluntness of manner is no longer\n",
    "excused on the ground that the speaker is sincere and outspoken. We\n",
    "expect and demand that our companion in conversation should observe the\n",
    "recognized courtesies of speech.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>There was a time when men and women indulged freely in satire, irony,\n",
    "and repartee. They spoke their thoughts plainly and unequivocally. There\n",
    "were no restraints imposed upon them by society, hence it now appears to\n",
    "us that many things were said which might better have been left unsaid.\n",
    "Self-restraint is nowadays one of the cardinal virtues of good\n",
    "conversation.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The spirit of conversation is greatly changed. We are enjoined to keep\n",
    "the voice low, think before we speak, repress unseasonable allusions,\n",
    "shun whatever may cause a jar or jolt in the minds of others, be seldom\n",
    "prominent in conversation, and avoid all clashing of opinion and\n",
    "collision of feeling.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Macaulay was fond of talking, but made the mistake of always choosing a\n",
    "subject to suit himself and monopolizing the conversation. He lectured\n",
    "rather than talked. His marvelous memory was perhaps his greatest enemy,\n",
    "for though it enabled him to pour forth great masses of facts, people\n",
    "listened to him helplessly rather than admiringly.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Carlyle was a great talker, and talked much in protest of talking. No\n",
    "man broke silence oftener than he to tell the world how great a curse is\n",
    "talking. But he told it eloquently and therein was he justified. There\n",
    "was in him too much vehement sternness, of hard Scotch granite, to make\n",
    "him a pleasant talker in the popular sense. He was the evangelist of\n",
    "golden silence, and though he did not apparently practice it himself,\n",
    "his genius will never diminish.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Gladstone was unable to indulge in small talk. His mind was so\n",
    "constantly occupied with great subjects that he spoke even to one person\n",
    "as if addressing a meeting. It is said that in conversation with Queen\n",
    "Victoria he would invariably choose weighty subjects, and though she\n",
    "tried to make a digression, he would seize the first opportunity to\n",
    "resume his original theme, always reinforced in volume and onrush by the\n",
    "delay.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Lord Morley is attractive though austere in conversation. He never\n",
    "dogmatizes nor obtrudes his own opinions. He is a master of\n",
    "phrase-making. But although he talks well he never talks much.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The story is told that at a recent dinner in London ten leading public\n",
    "men were met together, when one suggested that each gentleman present\n",
    "should write down on paper the name of the man he would specially choose\n",
    "to be his companion on a walking tour. When the ten papers were\n",
    "subsequently read aloud, each bore the name of Lord Morley.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Lord Rosebery is considered one of the most accomplished talkers of the\n",
    "day. Deferential, natural, sympathetic, observant, well-informed, he\n",
    "easily and unconsciously commands the attention of any group of men. His\n",
    "voice is said to recommend what he utters, and a singularly refined\n",
    "accent gives distinction to anything he says. He is a supreme example of\n",
    "two great qualifications for effective talking: having something worth\n",
    "while to say, and knowing how to say it.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Among distinguished Canadians, Sir Thomas White is one of the most\n",
    "interesting speakers. His versatile mind, and broad and varied\n",
    "experience, enable him to converse with almost equal facility upon\n",
    "politics, medicine, finance, law, science, art, literature, or\n",
    "business. Dates, details, facts, figures, and illustrations are at his\n",
    "ready command. His manner is natural, courteous, and genial, but in\n",
    "argumentation the whole man is so thoroughly aroused to earnestness and\n",
    "intensity as almost to overwhelm an opponent. His greatest quality in\n",
    "speaking is his manifest sincerity, and it is this particularly which\n",
    "has ingratiated him in the hearts of his countrymen.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The Honorable Joseph H. Choate must certainly be reckoned among the best\n",
    "conversationalists of our time. His manner, both in conversation and in\n",
    "public speaking, is singularly gracious and winning. He is unsurpassed\n",
    "as a story-teller. His fine taste, combined with long experience as a\n",
    "public man, makes him an ideal after-dinner speaker.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Some eminent men try to mask their greatness when engaged in\n",
    "conversation. They do not wear their feelings nor their greatness on\n",
    "their sleeves. Some have an utter distaste for anything like personal\n",
    "display. It is said of the late Henry James that a stranger might talk\n",
    "to him for an entire evening without discovering his identity.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>There is an interesting account of an evening's conversation between\n",
    "Emerson and Thoreau. When Thoreau returned home he wrote in his Journal:\n",
    "\"Talked, or tried to talk, with R.W.E. Lost my time, nay, almost my\n",
    "identity. He, assuming a false opposition where there was no difference\n",
    "of opinion, talked to the wind.\" Emerson's version of the conversation\n",
    "was this: \"It seemed as if Thoreau's first instinct on hearing a\n",
    "proposition was to controvert it. That habit is chilling to the social\n",
    "affections; it mars conversation.\"</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Conversation offers daily opportunity for intellectual exercise of high\n",
    "order. The reading of great books is desirable and indispensable to\n",
    "education, but real culture comes through the additional training one\n",
    "receives in conversation. The contact of mind with mind tends to\n",
    "stimulate and develop thoughts which otherwise would probably remain\n",
    "dormant.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The culture of conversation is to be recommended not only for its own\n",
    "sake, but also as one of the best means of training in the art of public\n",
    "speaking. Since the best form of platform address today is simply\n",
    "conversation enlarged and elevated, it may almost be assumed that to\n",
    "excel in one is to be proficient in the other.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Good conversation requires, among other things, mental alertness,\n",
    "accuracy of statement, adequate vocabulary, facility of expression, and\n",
    "an agreeable voice, and these qualities are most essential for effective\n",
    "public speaking. Everyone, therefore, who aspires to speaking before an\n",
    "audience of hundreds or thousands, will find his best opportunity for\n",
    "preliminary training in everyday speech.</p>"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>There is no greater affliction in modern life than the tiresome talker.\n",
    "He talks incessantly. Presumably he talks in his sleep. Talking is his\n",
    "constant exercise and recreation. He thrives on it. He lives for\n",
    "talking's sake. He would languish if he were deprived of it for a single\n",
    "day. His continuous practice in talking enables him easily to\n",
    "outdistance all ordinary competitors. There is nothing which so\n",
    "completely unnerves him as long periods of silence. He has the talking\n",
    "habit in its most virulent form.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The trifling talker is equally objectionable. He talks much, but says\n",
    "little. He skims over the surface of things, and is timid of anything\n",
    "deep or philosophical. He does not tarry at one subject. He talks of the\n",
    "weather, clothes, plays, and sports. He puts little meaning into what he\n",
    "says, because there is little meaning in what he thinks. He cannot look\n",
    "at anything seriously. Nothing is of great significance to him. He is\n",
    "in the class of featherweights.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The tedious talker is one without terminal facilities. He talks right on\n",
    "with no idea of objective or destination. He rises to go, but he does\n",
    "not go. He knows he ought to go, but he simply cannot. He has something\n",
    "more to say. He keeps you standing half an hour. He talks a while\n",
    "longer. He assures you he really must go. You tell him not to hurry. He\n",
    "takes you at your word and sits down again. He talks some more. He rises\n",
    "again. He does not know even now how to conclude. He has no mental\n",
    "compass. He is a rudderless talker.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Probably the most obnoxious type is the tattling talker. He always has\n",
    "something startlingly personal to impart. It is a sacred secret for your\n",
    "ear. He is a wholesale dealer in gossip. He fairly smacks his lips as he\n",
    "relates the latest scandal. He is an expert embellisher. He adroitly\n",
    "supplies missing details. He has nothing of interest in his own life,\n",
    "since he lives wholly in the lives of others. He is a frightful bore,\n",
    "but you cannot offend him. He is adamant.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>There is the tautological talker, or the human self-repeater. He goes\n",
    "over the ground again and again lest you have missed something. He is\n",
    "very fond of himself. He tells the same story not twice, but a dozen\n",
    "times. \"You may have heard this before,\" says he, \"but it is so good\n",
    "that it will bear repetition.\" He tries to disguise his poverty of\n",
    "thought in a masquerade of ornate language. If he must repeat his words,\n",
    "he adds a little emphasis, a flourishing gesture, or a spirit of\n",
    "nonchalance.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Again, there is the tenacious talker, who refuses to release you though\n",
    "you concede his arguments. When all others tacitly drop a subject, he\n",
    "eagerly picks it up. He is reluctant to leave it. He would put you in\n",
    "possession of his special knowledge. You may successfully refute him,\n",
    "but he holds firmly to his own ideas. He is positive he is right. He\n",
    "will prove it, too, if you will only listen. He knows that he knows. You\n",
    "cannot convince him to the contrary, no indeed. He will talk you so\n",
    "blind that at last you are unable to see any viewpoint clearly.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>A recognized type is the tactless talker. He says the wrong thing in\n",
    "the right way, and the right thing in the wrong way. He is impulsive and\n",
    "unguarded. He reaches hasty conclusions. He confuses his tactlessness\n",
    "with cleverness. He is awkward and blundering. His indifference to the\n",
    "rights and feelings of others is his greatest enemy. He is a stranger to\n",
    "discretion. He speaks first, and thinks afterwards. He may have regrets,\n",
    "but not resolutions. He is often tolerated, but seldom esteemed.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The temperamental talker is one of the greatest of nerve-destroyers. He\n",
    "deals in superlatives. He views everything emotionally. He talks\n",
    "feelingly of trifles, and ecstatically of friends. He gushes. He\n",
    "flatters. To him everything is \"wonderful,\" \"prodigious,\" \"superb,\"\n",
    "\"gorgeous,\" \"heavenly,\" \"amazing,\" \"indescribable,\" \"overwhelming.\"\n",
    "Extravagance and exaggeration permeate his most commonplace\n",
    "observations. He is an incurable enthusiast.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The tantalizing talker is one who likes to contradict you. He divides\n",
    "his attention between what you are saying and what he can summon to\n",
    "oppose you. He dissents from your most ordinary observations. His\n",
    "favorite phrases are, \"I don't think so,\" \"There is where you are\n",
    "wrong,\" \"I beg to differ,\" and \"Not only that.\" Tell him it will be a\n",
    "fine day, and he will declare that the signs indicate foul weather. Say\n",
    "that the day is unpromising, and he will assure you it does not look\n",
    "that way to him. He cavils at trifles. He disputes even when there is no\n",
    "antagonist.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>To listen to the tortuous talker is a supreme test of patience. He\n",
    "slowly winds his way in and out of a subject. He traverses by-paths,\n",

    "<p>There is a widespread need for a more thorough cultivation of the\n",

    "attention to this important subject. On all sides we are subjected to\n",
    "voices that are disagreeable and strident. It is the exception to hear a\n",
    "voice that is musical and well-modulated.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Most people make too much physical effort in speaking. They tighten the\n",
    "muscles of the throat and mouth, instead of liberating these muscles and\n",
    "allowing the voice to flow naturally and harmoniously. The remedy for\n",
    "this common fault of vocal tension is to relax all the muscles used in\n",
    "speech. This is easily accomplished by means of a little daily practice.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The first thing to keep in mind is that we should speak through the\n",
    "throat and not from it. A musical quality of voice depends chiefly upon\n",
    "directing the tone towards the hard palate, or the bony arch above the\n",
    "upper teeth. From this part of the mouth the voice acquires much of its\n",
    "resonance.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>An excellent exercise for throat relaxation is yawning. It is not\n",
    "necessary to wait until a real yawn presents itself, but frequent\n",
    "practice in imitating a yawn may be indulged in with good results.\n",
    "Immediately after practicing the yawn, it is advisable to test the\n",
    "voice, either in speaking or in reading, to observe improvement in\n",
    "freedom of tone.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>It is not desirable to use the voice where there is loud noise by way of\n",
    "opposition. Many a good voice has been ruined due to the habit of\n",
    "continuous talking on the street or elsewhere amid clatter and hubbub.\n",
    "Under such circumstances it is better to rest the voice, since in any\n",
    "contest of the kind the voice will almost surely be vanquished.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>What we need in our daily conversation is less emphasis, and more\n",
    "quietness and non-resistance. We need less eagerness and more vivacity\n",
    "and variety. We need a settled equanimity of mind that does not deprive\n",
    "us of our animation, but saves us from the petty irritations of\n",
    "everyday life. We need, in short, more poise and self-control in our way\n",
    "of speaking.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>It is well to remember that few things we say are of such importance as\n",
    "to require emphasis. The thought should be its own recommendation. But\n",
    "if emphasis be necessary, let it be by the intellectual means of pausing\n",
    "or inflection, rather than with the shoulders or the clenched fist.</p>\n",

    "<p>A very disagreeable and common fault is nasality, or \"talking through\n",
    "the nose.\" Many persons are guilty of this who least suspect it. This\n",
    "habit is so easily and unconsciously acquired that everyone should be on\n",
    "strict guard against it. Almost equally disagreeable is the fault of\n",
    "throatiness, caused by holding the muscles of the throat instead of\n",
    "relaxing them.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The best tones of the speaking voice are the middle and low keys. These\n",
    "should be used exclusively in daily conversation. The use of high pitch\n",
    "is due to habit or temperament, but may be overcome through judicious\n",
    "practice. The objection to a high-keyed voice is not only that it is\n",
    "disagreeable to the listener, but puts the speaker \"out of tune\" with\n",

    "<p>A good speaking voice should possess the qualities of purity, resonance,\n",
    "flexibility, roundness, brilliancy, and adequate power. These qualities\n",
    "can be rapidly developed by daily reading aloud for ten minutes, giving\n",
    "special attention to one quality at a time. A few weeks, assiduous\n",

    "correct speech should be a student of the dictionary. A writer has given\n",
    "this good counsel:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\"Resolve that you will never use an incorrect, an inelegant, or a vulgar\n",
    "phrase or word, in any society whatever. If you are gifted with wit, you\n",
    "will soon find that it is easy to give it far better point and force in\n",
    "pure English than through any other medium, and that brilliant thoughts\n",
    "make the deepest impressions when well worded. However great it may be,\n",
    "the labor is never lost which earns for you the reputation of one who\n",
    "habitually uses the language of a gentleman, or of a lady. It is\n",
    "difficult for those who have not frequent opportunities for conversation\n",
    "with well-educated people, to avoid using expressions which are not\n",
    "current in society, although they may be of common occurrence in books.\n",
    "As they are often learned from novels, it will be well for the reader to\n",
    "remember that even in the best of such works dialogues are seldom\n",
    "sustained in a tone which would not appear affected in ordinary life.\n",
    "This fault in conversation is the most difficult of all to amend, and it\n",
    "is unfortunately the one to which those who strive to express themselves\n",
    "correctly are peculiarly liable. Its effect is bad, for though it is not\n",
    "like slang, vulgar in itself, it betrays an effort to conceal vulgarity.\n",
    "It may generally be remedied by avoiding any word or phrase which you\n",
    "may suspect yourself of using for the purpose of creating an effect.\n",
    "Whenever you imagine that the employment of any mere word or sentence\n",
    "will convey the impression that you are well informed, substitute for\n",
    "it some simple expression. If you are not positively certain as to the\n",
    "pronunciation of a word, never use it. If the temptation be great,\n",
    "resist it; for, rely upon it, if there be in your mind the slightest\n",
    "doubt on the subject, you will certainly make a mistake. Never use a\n",
    "foreign word when its meaning can be given in English, and remember that\n",
    "it is both rude and silly to say anything to any person who possibly may\n",
    "not understand it. But never attempt, under any circumstances whatever,\n",
    "to utter a foreign word, unless you have learned to pronounce correctly\n",
    "the language to which it belongs.\"</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>There is need for the admonition to open the mouth well. Many people\n",
    "speak with half-closed teeth, the result being that the quality of voice\n",
    "and correctness of pronunciation are greatly impaired. Consonants and\n",
    "vowels should be given proper significance. Muffled speech is almost as\n",
    "objectionable as stammering.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>It enhances the pleasure and quality of conversation to speak in\n",
    "deliberate style. Rapidity of utterance often leads a speaker into such\n",
    "faults as indistinctness, monotony, and incorrect breathing. Deliberate\n",
    "speaking confers many advantages, not the least of which is increased\n",
    "pleasure to the listener.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Many voices are too thin in quality. They fail to carry conviction even\n",
    "when the thought is of superior character. The remedy here is to give\n",
    "special attention to the development of deep tones. One of the best\n",
    "exercises for this purpose is to practice for a few minutes daily upon\n",
    "the vowel sound \"O,\" endeavoring to make it full, deep, and melodious.\n",
    "For all-round vocal development this practice should be done with varied\n",
    "force and inflection, and on high as well as low keys of the voice.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The best remedy for a weak voice is to practice daily upon explosives,\n",
    "expelling the principal vowel sounds, on various keys, using the\n",
    "abdominal muscles throughout. Another good exercise is to read aloud\n",
    "while walking upstairs or uphill. As these exercises are somewhat\n",
    "extreme, the student is recommended to practice them prudently.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Correct breathing is fundamental to correct and agreeable speaking. The\n",
    "breathing apparatus should be brought under control by daily practice\n",
    "upon exercises prescribed in any standard book on elocution. Pure tone\n",
    "of voice depends upon the ability to convert into tone every particle of\n",
    "breath used. Aspirated voice, in which some of the breath is allowed to\n",
    "escape unvocalized, is injurious to the throat, and unpleasant to the\n",
    "listening ear.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The speaker, whether in conversation or in public, should try always to\n",
    "speak with an adequate supply of breath. Deliberate utterance will give\n",
    "the necessary opportunity to replenish the lungs, so that the speaker\n",
    "will not suffer from unnecessary fatigue. Needless to say, the habit\n",
    "should be formed of breathing through the nose when in repose.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>There is a voice of unusual roundness and fulness known as the orotund,\n",
    "which is indispensable to the public speaker. It is simple, pure tone,\n",
    "rounded out into greater fulness. It is produced mainly by an increased\n",
    "resonance of the chest and mouth cavities, and a more vigorous action of\n",
    "the abdominal muscles. It has the character of fulness, but it is not\n",
    "necessarily a loud tone. It is in no sense artificial, but simply an\n",
    "enlargement of the natural conversational voice.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The use of the orotund voice varies according to the intensity of the\n",
    "thought and feeling being expressed. It is used in language of great\n",
    "dignity, power, grandeur, and sublimity. It is appropriate in certain\n",
    "forms of public prayer and Bible reading. It enables the public speaker\n",
    "to vary from his conversational style. It gives vastly increased scope\n",
    "and power, by enabling the speaker to bring into play all the resources\n",
    "of vocal force and intensity.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Where resonance of voice is lacking, it can be rapidly developed by\n",
    "means of humming the letter <i>m</i>, with lips closed, and endeavoring to\n",
    "make the face vibrate. The tone should be kept well forward throughout\n",
    "the exercise, pressing firmly against the lips and hard palate. Later\n",
    "the exercise may begin with the humming <i>m</i>, and be developed, while the\n",
    "lips are opened gradually, into the tone of <i>ah</i>, still aiming to\n",
    "maintain the original resonance.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The speaking voice is capable of most wonderful development. There is a\n",
    "duty devolving upon everyone to cultivate beauty of vocal utterance and\n",
    "diction. Crudities of speech so commonly in evidence are mainly due to\n",
    "carelessness and neglect. It is a hopeful sign, however, that greater\n",
    "attention is now being given to this important subject than heretofore.\n",
    "Surely there is nothing more important than the development of the\n",

    "\n",
    "<p>Someone has wittily said that only those in their anecdotage should tell\n",
    "stories. De Quincey wanted all story-tellers to be submerged in a\n",
    "horse-pond, or treated in the same manner as mad dogs. But story-telling\n",
    "has its legitimate and appropriate use, and if certain rules are\n",
    "observed may give added charm to conversation and public speaking.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>It requires a fine discrimination to know when to tell a story, and when\n",
    "not to tell one though it is urging itself to be expressed. Few men have\n",
    "the rare gift of choosing the right story for the particular occasion.\n",
    "Many men have no difficulty in telling stories that are insufferably\n",
    "long, pointless, and uninteresting.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>We have all been victims of a certain type of public speaker who begins\n",
    "by saying, \"Now I don't want to bore you with a long story, but this is\n",
    "so good, etc.,\" or \"An incident occurred at the American Consulate in\n",
    "Shanghai, which reminds me of an awfully good story, etc.\" When a\n",
    "speaker prefaces his remarks with some such sentences as these, we know\n",
    "we are in for an uncomfortable time.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>As far as possible a story should be new, clever, short, simple,\n",
    "inoffensive, and appropriate. As such stories are scarce, it is\n",
    "advisable to set them down, when found, in a special note-book for\n",
    "convenient reference. It is said that Chauncey M. Depew, one of the most\n",
    "gifted of after-dinner speakers, was for many years in the habit of\n",
    "keeping a set of scrap-books in which were preserved stories and other\n",
    "interesting data clipped from newspapers and magazines. These were so\n",
    "classified that he could on short notice refresh his mind with ample\n",
    "material upon almost any general subject.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Anyone who essays to tell a story should have it clearly in mind. It is\n",
    "fatal for a speaker to hesitate midway in a story, apologize for not\n",
    "knowing it better, avow that it was much more humorous when told to him,\n",
    "and in other ways to announce his shortcomings. If he cannot tell a\n",
    "story fluently and interestingly, he should first practice it on his own\n",
    "family—provided they will tolerate it.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Some stories should be committed to memory, especially where the point\n",
    "of humor depends upon exact phraseology. In such case, it requires some\n",
    "training and experience to disguise the memorized effort. A story like\n",
    "the following, for obvious reasons, should be thoroughly memorized:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The longest sermon on record occupied three hours and a half. But the\n",
    "shortest sermon was that of a preacher who spoke for one minute on the\n",
    "text: \"Man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward.\" He said:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\"I shall divide my discourse into three heads: (1) Man's ingress into\n",
    "the world; (2) His progress through the world; (3) His egress out of the\n",
    "world.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\"Firstly, His ingress into the world is naked and bare.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\"Secondly, His progress through the world is trouble and care.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\"Thirdly, His egress out of the world is nobody knows where.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\"To conclude:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\"If we live well here, we shall live well there.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\"I can tell you no more if I preach a whole year.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\"The collection will now be taken up.\"</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Dialect stories are usually rather difficult, and should not as a\n",
    "general thing be attempted by beginners. As a matter of fact, few\n",
    "persons know how to speak such dialects as Irish, Scotch, German,\n",
    "Cockney, and negro without undue exaggeration. For most occasions it is\n",
    "well to keep to simple stories couched in plain English.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>A story should be told in simple, conversational style. Concentration\n",
    "upon the story, and a sincere desire to give pleasure to the hearers,\n",
    "will keep the speaker free from self-consciousness. Needless to say he\n",
    "should not be the first to laugh at his own story. Sometimes in telling\n",
    "a humorous anecdote to an audience a speaker secures the greatest effect\n",
    "by maintaining an expression of extreme gravity.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>No matter how successful one may be in telling stories, he should avoid\n",
    "telling too many. A man who is accounted brilliant and entertaining may\n",
    "become an insufferable bore by continuing to tell stories when the\n",

    "slightest signs of weariness.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>It is superfluous to say that a story should never be told which in any\n",
    "way might give offence. The speaker may raise a laugh, but lose a\n",
    "friend. Hence it is that stories about stammerers, red-headed people,\n",
    "mothers-in-law, and the like, should always be chosen with\n",
    "discrimination.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Generally the most effective story is one in which the point of humor is\n",
    "not disclosed until the very last words, as in the following:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>An old colored man was brought up before a country judge.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\"Jethro,\" said the judge, \"you are accused of stealing General Johnson's\n",

    "\n",
    "<p>This is a similar example, told by Prime Minister Asquith:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>An English professor wrote on the blackboard in his laboratory,\n",
    "\"Professor Blank informs his students that he has this day been\n",
    "appointed honorary physician to his Majesty, King George.\"</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>During the morning he had some occasion to leave the room, and found on\n",
    "his return that some student wag had added the words,</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\"God save the King!\"</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Henry W. Grady was a facile story-teller. One of his best stories was as\n",
    "follows:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\"There was an old preacher once who told some boys of the Bible lesson\n",
    "he was going to read in the morning. The boys, finding the place, glued\n",
    "together the connecting pages. The next morning he read on the bottom of\n",
    "one page: 'When Noah was one hundred and twenty years old he took unto\n",
    "himself a wife, who was'—then turning the page—'one hundred and forty\n",
    "cubits long, forty cubits wide, built of gopherwood, and covered with\n",
    "pitch inside and out.' He was naturally puzzled at this. He read it\n",
    "again, verified it, and then said: 'My friends, this is the first time\n",
    "I ever met this in the Bible, but I accept it as an evidence of the\n",
    "assertion that we are fearfully and wonderfully made.'\"</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Personalities based upon sarcasm or invective are always attended with\n",
    "danger, but good-humored bantering may be used upon occasion with most\n",
    "happy results. As an instance of this, there is a story of an annual\n",
    "dinner at which Mr. Choate was set down for the toast, \"The Navy,\" and\n",
    "Mr. Depew was to respond to \"The Army.\" Mr. Depew began by saying, \"It's\n",
    "well to have a specialist: that's why Choate is here to speak about the\n",
    "Navy. We met at the wharf once and I did not see him again till we\n",
    "reached Liverpool. When I asked how he felt he said he thought he would\n",
    "have enjoyed the trip over if he had had any ocean air. Yes, you want to\n",
    "hear Choate on the Navy.\" When it was Mr. Choate's turn to speak, he\n",
    "said: \"I've heard Depew hailed as the greatest after-dinner speaker. If\n",
    "after-dinner speaking, as I have heard it described and as I believe it\n",
    "to be, is the art of saying nothing at all, then Mr. Depew is the most\n",
    "marvelous speaker in the universe.\"</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The medical profession can be assailed with impunity, since they have\n",
    "long since grown accustomed to it. There is a story of a young laborer\n",
    "who, on his way to his day's work, called at the registrar's office to\n",
    "register his father's death. When the official asked the date of the\n",
    "event, the son replied, \"He ain't dead yet, but he'll be dead before\n",
    "night, so I thought it would save me another journey if you would put it\n",
    "down now.\" \"Oh, that won't do at all,\" said the registrar; \"perhaps your\n",
    "father will live till tomorrow.\" \"Well, I don't think so, sir; the\n",
    "doctor says as he won't, and he knows what he has given him.\"</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>While stories should be used sparingly, there is probably nothing more\n",
    "effective before a popular audience than the telling of a story in which\n",
    "the joke is on the speaker himself. Thus:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The last time I made a speech, I went next day to the editor of our\n",
    "local newspaper, and said,</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\"I thought your paper was friendly to me?\"</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The editor said, \"So it is. What's the matter?\"</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\"Well,\" I said, \"I made a speech last night, and you didn't print a\n",
    "single line of it this morning.\"</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\"Well,\" said the editor, \"what further proof do you want?\"</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Many of the best and most effective stories are serious in character.\n",
    "One that has been used successfully is this: Some gentlemen from the\n",
    "West were excited and troubled about the commissions or omissions of the\n",
    "administration. President Lincoln heard them patiently, and then\n",
    "replied: \"Gentlemen, suppose all the property you were worth was in\n",
    "gold, and you had put it in the hands of Blondin to carry across the\n",
    "Niagara River on a rope; would you shake the cable, or keep shouting out\n",
    "to him—'Blondin, stand up a little straighter—Blondin, stoop a little\n",
    "more—go a little faster—lean a little more to the north—lean a little\n",
    "more to the south?' No, you would hold your breath as well as your\n",
    "tongue, and keep your hands off until he was safe over. The Government\n",
    "is carrying an immense weight. Untold treasures are in our hands. We are\n",
    "doing the very best we can. Don't badger us. Keep silence, and we'll get\n",
    "you safe across.\"</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Punning is of course out of fashion. The best pun in the English\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Dr. Johnson said that the pun was the lowest order of wit. Newspapers\n",
    "formerly indulged in it freely. One editor would say: \"We don't care a\n",
    "straw what Shakespeare said—a rose by any other name would not smell as\n",
    "wheat.\" Then another paper would answer: \"Such puns are barley\n",
    "tolerable, they amaize us, they arouse our righteous corn, and they turn\n",
    "the public taste a-rye.\"</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>But punning, when it is unusually clever and spontaneous, may be\n",
    "thoroughly enjoyable, as in the following:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Chief Justice Story attended a public dinner in Boston at which Edward\n",
    "Everett was present. Desiring to pay a delicate compliment to the\n",

    "\n",
    "<p>Story-telling may attain the character of a disease, in one who has a\n",
    "retentive memory and a voluble vocabulary. The form of humor known as\n",
    "repartee, however, is one that requires rare discrimination. It should\n",
    "be used sparingly, and not at all if it is likely to give offence.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Beau Brummell was guilty in this respect, when he was once asked by a\n",
    "lady if he would \"take a cup of tea.\" \"Thank you,\" said he, \"I never\n",
    "<i>take</i> anything but physic.\" \"I beg your pardon,\" said the hostess, \"you\n",

    "\n",
    "<p>The art of story-telling is not taught specifically, hence there are\n",

    "<p>Every salesman has unexpected problems to solve. A sensitive or touchy\n",
    "customer may become unreasonably angry or offended. What is the salesman\n",
    "to do? He should here be particularly on his guard not to show the\n",
    "slightest resentment. Though he may be wholly guiltless, he cannot\n",
    "afford to contradict the customer, nor to challenge him to a vocal duel.\n",
    "If he talks at all, he should talk quietly and reasonably, and always\n",
    "with the object of bringing the customer around to a favorable point of\n",
    "view.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The successful salesman must have tact and discrimination. He must know\n",
    "when and how to check in himself the word or phrase which is trying to\n",
    "force its way out into expression, but which would in the end prove\n",
    "inadvisable. He must train himself to choose quickly the right and best\n",
    "course under difficult circumstances.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The salesman should give his undivided attention to the customer. If the\n",
    "salesman is speaking, he should speak clearly, directly, concisely, and\n",
    "understandingly; if he is listening, he should listen interestedly and\n",
    "thoroughly, with all his powers alive and receptive.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The salesman should know when to speak and when to be silent. Some\n",
    "customers wish to be told much, others prefer to think for themselves.\n",
    "He is a wise salesman who knows when to be mute. Loquacity has often\n",
    "killed what otherwise might have been a good sale.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>There is a certain tone of voice which the salesman should aim to\n",
    "acquire. It is neither high nor low in pitch. It is agreeable to the\n",
    "listening ear, and is almost sufficient in itself to win the favorable\n",
    "attention of the prospective buyer. Every salesman should cultivate a\n",
    "musical and well-modulated voice as one of the chief assets in\n",
    "salesmanship.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The salesman should cultivate dignity of speech and manner. People\n",
    "generally dislike familiarity, joking, and horse-play. It is well to\n",
    "assume that the customer is serious-minded, that he means business and\n",
    "nothing else. Needless to say, the telling of long stories, or personal\n",
    "experiences, has no legitimate place in the business of salesmanship.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>There is a proper time and place for short story-telling. Like\n",
    "everything else it is all right in its appropriate setting. Lincoln used\n",
    "it to advantage, but once said: \"I believe I have the popular reputation\n",
    "of being a story-teller, but I do not deserve the name in its general\n",
    "sense; for it is not the story itself, but its purpose, or effect, that\n",
    "interests me. I often avoid a long and useless discussion by others, or\n",
    "a laborious explanation on my part, by a short story that illustrates my\n",
    "point of view.\"</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The salesman should resolve not to lose his poise and agreeableness\n",
    "under any circumstances. Irritability never attracts business. To say\n",
    "the right thing in the right place is desirable, but it is quite as\n",
    "important, though more difficult, to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the\n",
    "moment of temptation.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>It is not the legitimate business of the salesman to force upon a\n",
    "customer what is really not wanted, but many times the customer does\n",
    "not know what he wants nor what he might be able to use. Hence the\n",
    "competent salesman should know how to influence the customer towards a\n",
    "favorable decision, using all honorable and approved means to bring\n",
    "about such a result.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The customer's unfavorable answer is not to be accepted always as final.\n",
    "He may not clearly understand the merits or uses of the article offered.\n",
    "He may need the explanations and suggestions of the salesman in order to\n",
    "reach a right conclusion. Here it is that the salesman may fulfill one\n",
    "of his most important duties.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>There is a wide difference between self-reliance and obtrusiveness.\n",
    "Every man should have a full degree of self-confidence. It is needed in\n",
    "every walk in life. But the salesman, more than most men, must have an\n",
    "exceptional degree of faith in himself and in what he has to sell.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>This self-confidence, however, is a very different thing from boldness\n",
    "or obtrusiveness. Courtesy and considerateness are cardinal qualities of\n",
    "the well-equipped salesman, but boastfulness, glibness, egotism,\n",
    "loudness, and self-assertion, are as distasteful as they are\n",
    "undesirable.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The eloquence and persuasiveness of silence is nowhere better\n",
    "exemplified than in the art of salesmanship. One man says much, and\n",
    "sells little; another says little, and sells much. The reason for the\n",
    "superior success of one over the other is mainly due to the fact that he\n",
    "knows best how to present the merits of what he offers for sale, knows\n",
    "how to say it concisely and effectively, knows how to ingratiate\n",
    "himself, largely through his personality, into the good graces of the\n",
    "prospective buyer, and knows when to stop talking.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Modern salesmanship is based primarily upon common sense. A man with\n",
    "brains, though possibly lacking in other desirable qualifications, may\n",
    "easily outdistance the more experienced salesman. It is a valuable thing\n",
    "in any man to be able to think accurately, reason deeply, and size up a\n",
    "situation promptly.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The salesman should at all times be on his best talking behavior. It is\n",
    "not advisable for him to have two standards of speech, and to use an\n",
    "inferior one excepting for special occasions. He should cultivate as a\n",
    "regular daily habit discrimination in the use of voice, enunciation,\n",
    "expression, and language. This should be the constant aim not only of\n",

    "occasion some friends surreptitiously cut the particular button off, and\n",
    "the result was that the speaker when he stood up to address the audience\n",
    "lost the thread of his discourse.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Gladstone had a mannerism of striking the palm of his left hand with the\n",
    "clenched fist of his other hand, so that often the emphatic word was\n",
    "lost in the noise of percussion. A common habit of the distinguished\n",
    "statesman was to reach out his right hand at full arm's length, and then\n",
    "to bend it back at the elbow and lightly scratch the top of his head\n",
    "with his thumb-nail.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Balfour, while speaking, used to take hold of the lapels of his coat by\n",
    "both hands as if he were in mortal fear of running away before he had\n",
    "finished.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Goshen, at the beginning of a speech, would sound his chest and sides\n",
    "with his hands, and apparently finding that his ribs were in good order,\n",
    "would proceed to wash his hands with invisible soap.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The strange thing about mannerisms is that the speakers are usually\n",
    "unconscious of them, and would be the first to condemn them in others.\n",
    "The remedy for such defects lies in thorough and severe self-examination\n",
    "and self-criticism. However eminent a speaker may be with objectionable\n",
    "mannerisms, he would be still greater without them.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Every public speaker has certain characteristics of voice and manner\n",
    "that distinguish him from other men. In so far as this individuality\n",
    "gives increased power and effectiveness to the speaking style, it is\n",
    "desirable and should be encouraged. When, however, it is carried to\n",
    "excess, or in any sense offends good taste, it is merely mannerism, and\n",
    "should be discouraged.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>There is an objectionable mannerism of the voice, known as \"pulpit\n",
    "tone,\" that has come to be associated with some preachers. It takes\n",
    "various forms, such as an unduly elevated key, a drawling monotone, a\n",
    "sudden transition from one extreme of pitch to another, or a tone of\n",
    "condescension. It is also heard in a plaintive minor inflection,\n",
    "imparting a quality of extreme sadness to a speaker's style. These are\n",
    "all departures from the natural, earnest, sincere, and direct delivery\n",
    "that belongs to the high office of preaching.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Still another undesirable mannerism of the voice is that of giving a\n",
    "rising inflection at the close of successive sentences that are\n",
    "obviously complete. Here the speaker's thought is left suspended in the\n",
    "air, the hearer feels a sense of disappointment or doubt, and possibly\n",
    "the entire meaning is perverted. Thoughts delivered in such a manner,\n",

    "<p>Artificiality, affectation, pomposity, mouthing, undue vehemence,\n",
    "monotony, intoning, and everything that detracts from the simplicity and\n",
    "genuine fervor of the speech should be avoided. Too much emphasis may\n",
    "drive a thought beyond the mark, and a conscious determination to make a\n",
    "\"great speech\" may keep the speaker in a state of anxiety throughout\n",
    "its entire delivery.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>A clear and correct enunciation is essential, but it should not be\n",
    "pedantic, nor should it attract attention to itself. \"What you are\n",
    "prevents me from hearing what you say,\" might also be applied to the\n",
    "manner of the speaker. Exaggerated opening of the mouth, audible\n",
    "smacking of the lips, holding tenaciously to final consonants, prolonged\n",
    "hissing of sibilants, are all to be condemned. Hesitation, stumbling\n",
    "over difficult combinations, obscuring final syllables, coalescing the\n",
    "last sound of one word with the first sound of the following word, are\n",
    "inexcusable in a trained speaker.</p>\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>There are two essential qualifications for making an effective public\n",
    "speech.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>First, having something worth-while to say.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Second, knowing how to say it.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The first qualification implies a judicious choice of subject and the\n",
    "most thorough preparation. It means that the speaker has carefully\n",
    "gathered together the best available material, and has so familiarized\n",
    "himself with his subject that he knows more about it than anyone else in\n",
    "his audience.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>It is in this requirement of thorough preparation that many public\n",
    "speakers are deficient. They do not realize the need for this\n",
    "painstaking preliminary work, and hence they frequently stand before an\n",
    "audience with little information of value to impart to their hearers.\n",
    "Their poverty of thought can not be long disguised in flamboyant\n",
    "rhetoric and sesquipedalian words, and hence they fail to carry\n",
    "conviction to serious-minded men.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>I would remind you that having something worth-while to say involves\n",
    "more than thorough preparation of the particular subject which the\n",
    "speaker is to present to an audience. The speaker should have a\n",
    "well-furnished mind. You have had the experience of listening to a\n",
    "public speaker who commanded your closest attention not only because of\n",
    "what he said, but also because of what he was. He inspired confidence in\n",
    "you because of his personality and reserve power.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>It is often what a man has within himself, rather than what he actually\n",
    "expresses, that carries greatest conviction to your mind. As you listen\n",
    "to such a man speak, you feel that he is worthy of your confidence\n",
    "because he draws upon broad experience and knowledge. He speaks out of\n",
    "the fulness of a well-furnished mind.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>It is important, therefore, that there should be mental culture in a\n",
    "broad way,—sound judgment, a sense of proportion and perspective, a\n",
    "fund of useful ideas, facts, arguments, and illustrations, and a large\n",
    "stock of common sense.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Every man who essays to speak in public should cultivate a judicial\n",
    "mind, or the habit of weighing and estimating facts and arguments. Such\n",
    "a mind is supposedly free from prejudice and seeks the truth at any\n",
    "cost. Such a mind does not want this or that to be necessarily true, but\n",
    "wants to recognize as true only that which is true.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>In these days of multiplied publications and books of all kinds, when\n",
    "printed matter of every description is soliciting our time and\n",
    "attention, it is particularly desirable that we should cultivate a\n",
    "discriminating taste in our choice of books. The highest purpose of\n",
    "reading is for the acquisition of useful knowledge and personal culture,\n",
    "and we should keep these two aims constantly before us. It is noteworthy\n",
    "that men who have achieved enduring greatness in the world have always\n",
    "had a good book at their ready command.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>If you are ever in doubt about the choice of books, you would do well to\n",
    "enlist the services of a literary friend, or ask the advice of a local\n",
    "librarian. But in any case, be on your guard against books and other\n",
    "publications of commonplace type, which can contribute nothing to the\n",
    "enrichment of your mind and life.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>It is desirable that you should own the books you read. The sense of\n",
    "personal possession will give an interest and pleasure to your reading\n",
    "which it would not otherwise have, and moreover you can freely mark such\n",
    "books with your pencil for subsequent reference. It is also well to have\n",
    "a note-book conveniently ready in which to jot down useful ideas as they\n",
    "occur to you.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Here we come to the use of the pen. All the great orators of the world\n",
    "have been prolific writers in the sense of writing out their thoughts.\n",
    "It is the only certain way to clarify your thought, to test it in\n",
    "advance of verbal expression and to examine it critically. The public\n",
    "speaker should write much in order to form a clear and flowing English\n",
    "style. It is surprising how many of our thoughts which appear to us\n",
    "clear and satisfactory, assume a peculiar vagueness when we attempt to\n",
    "set them down definitely in writing.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The use of the pen tends to give clearness and conciseness to the\n",
    "speaker's style. It makes him careful and accurate. It aids, too, in\n",
    "fixing the ideas of his speech in his mind, so that at the moment of\n",
    "addressing an audience they will respond most readily to his needs.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>A well-furnished mind is like a well-furnished house. In furnishing a\n",
    "house we do not fill it up with miscellaneous furniture, bric-a-brac and\n",
    "antiques, gathered promiscuously, but we plan everything with a view to\n",
    "harmony, beauty, and utility. We furnish a particular room in a tone\n",
    "that will be restful and pleasing to the occupant. We choose every piece\n",
    "of furniture, rug, picture, and drapery with a distinct purpose in view\n",
    "of what the total effect will be.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>So with a well-furnished mind. We must choose the kind of material we\n",
    "intend to keep there. It should be chosen with a view to its beauty,\n",
    "power, and usefulness. We want no rubbish there. We want the best\n",
    "material available. Hence the vital importance of going to the right\n",
    "sources for the furniture of our mind, to the great books of the world,\n",
    "to living authorities, to nature, to music, to art, to the best wherever\n",
    "it may be found.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The second essential of an effective public speech is knowing how to say\n",
    "it. This implies a thorough training in the technique of speech. There\n",
    "should be a well-cultivated voice, of adequate volume, brilliancy, and\n",
    "carrying quality. There should be ample training in articulation,\n",
    "pronunciation, expression, and gesture. These so-called mechanics should\n",
    "be developed until they become an unconscious part of the speaker's\n",
    "style.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Your best opportunity for practice is in your everyday conversation.\n",
    "There you are constantly making speeches on a small scale. Public\n",
    "speaking of the best modern type is simply elevated conversation. I do\n",
    "not mean elevated in pitch, but in the sense of being launched upon a\n",
    "higher level of thought and with greater intensity than is usually\n",
    "called for by ordinary conversation.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>In conversation you have your best opportunity for developing your\n",
    "public speaking style. Indeed, you are there, despite yourself, forming\n",
    "habits which will disclose themselves in your public speaking. As you\n",
    "speak in your daily conversation you will largely speak when you stand\n",
    "before an audience.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>You will therefore see the importance of care in your daily speech.\n",
    "There should be a fastidious choice of words, care in pronunciation and\n",
    "articulation, and the mouth well opened so that the words may come out\n",
    "wholly through the mouth and not partly through the nose. Culture of\n",
    "conversation is to be recommended for its own sake, since everyone must\n",
    "speak in private if not in public.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>One of the best plans for self-culture in speaking is to read aloud for\n",
    "a few minutes every day from a book of well-selected speeches. There are\n",
    "numerous compilations of the kind admirably suited to this purpose. The\n",
    "important thing here is to read in speaking style, not in what is termed\n",
    "reading style as usually taught in schools. When you practise in this\n",
    "way it would be well to imagine an audience before you and to render the\n",
    "speech as if emanating from your own mind. The student of public\n",
    "speaking will wisely guard himself against acquiring an artificial style\n",
    "or other mannerism.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Another good plan is to make short mental speeches while walking. When\n",
    "possible it is well to choose a country road for this purpose, or a\n",
    "park, or some other place where one's mind is not likely to be often\n",
    "diverted by passers-by. Lord Dufferin, the eminent British orator, was\n",
    "accustomed to prepare most of his speeches while riding on horseback.\n",
    "The habit of forming mental speeches is a great aid to actual\n",
    "speech-making, as it tends to give the mind a power and an adaptability\n",
    "which it would not otherwise have.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The painter, the musician, the sculptor, the architect, and other\n",
    "craftsmen search out models for study and inspiration. The public\n",
    "speaker should do likewise, and history shows that the great orators of\n",
    "the world have followed this practise. You can not do better than take\n",
    "as your model the greatest short speech in all history, the Gettysburg\n",
    "Address.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>An authority on English style has critically examined this speech and\n",
    "acknowledges that he cannot suggest a single change in it which would\n",

    "of November 18, 1863, Abraham Lincoln was travelling from Washington to\n",
    "take part next day in the consecration of the national cemetery at\n",
    "Gettysburg. He wrote his speech on a scrap of wrapping-paper, carefully\n",
    "fitting word to word, changing and correcting it in minutest detail as\n",
    "best he could until it was finished.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The next day after the speech had been delivered, Edward Everett, the\n",
    "trained and polished orator, said that he would have been content to\n",
    "have made in his oration of two hours the impression which Lincoln had\n",
    "made in that many minutes.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>It will repay you to study this speech closely and to wrest from it its\n",
    "innermost secrets of power and effectiveness. The greatest underlying\n",
    "quality of this speech is its rare simplicity—simplicity of thought,\n",
    "simplicity of language, simplicity of purpose, and shining through it\n",
    "all, the simplicity of the great emancipator himself.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>This simplicity is one of the great distinguishing qualities of\n",
    "effective public speaking. It is characteristic of all true art. It is\n",
    "subtle and difficult to define, but Fénelon gives a definition that will\n",
    "aid us when he says, \"Simplicity is an uprightness of soul that has no\n",
    "reference to self.\" It is another word for unselfishness.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>In these days of self-exploitation and self-aggrandizement, how\n",
    "refreshing it is to meet a man of true simplicity. We are won by his\n",
    "unaffected manner, his gentleness of argument, his ingratiating tones of\n",
    "voice, his freedom from prejudice and passion. Such a man wins us almost\n",
    "wholly by the power of his simplicity.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>This supreme quality is noticeable in men who are said to have come to\n",
    "themselves. They have tasted and tested life, they have learned\n",
    "proportion and perspective, they have appraised things at their real\n",
    "value, and now they carry themselves in poise and power and confidence.\n",
    "They have found themselves in a high and true sense, and they have come\n",
    "to be known as men of simplicity.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Simplicity is not to be confounded with weakness or ignorance. It comes\n",
    "through long education. It does not mean the trite, or the commonplace,\n",
    "or the obvious. It is a strong and sturdy quality, is this simplicity of\n",
    "which I am speaking, and nothing else will atone for lack of it in the\n",
    "public speaker.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Longfellow calls it the supreme excellence, since it is the quality\n",
    "which above all others brings serenity to the soul and makes life\n",
    "really worth living. Every man should earnestly seek to cultivate this\n",
    "great quality as essential to noble character.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>This speech is conspicuous for another indispensable quality for\n",
    "effective public speaking,—the quality of sincerity. It grows largely\n",
    "out of simplicity and is the product of integrity of mind and heart. Men\n",
    "recognize it quickly, though they cannot easily tell whence it comes. We\n",
    "find it highly developed in great leaders in business and professional\n",
    "life. There has never been a really great public speaker who was not\n",
    "preeminently a sincere man.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Beecher said, \"Let no man who is a sneak try to be an orator.\" Such a\n",
    "man can not be. He will shortly be found out. The world's ultimate\n",
    "estimate of a man is not far wrong.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>A politician of much promise was addressing a distinguished audience in\n",
    "Washington. The Opera House was crowded to the doors to hear him and\n",
    "apparently he was making a good impression upon all his hearers. But\n",
    "suddenly, at the very climax of his speech, while upwards of two\n",
    "thousand eyes were rivetted upon him, he was seen to wink at a personal\n",
    "friend of his sitting in a nearby box, and at that instant his future\n",
    "political prospects were shattered as a vase struck by lightning. In\n",
    "that single instant of insincerity he was appraised by that\n",
    "discriminating audience and his doom was sealed.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Still another great quality in the Gettysburg speech is its directness.\n",
    "The speaker had a clearly-defined purpose in view. He knew what he\n",
    "wanted to say, and he proceeded to say it—no more, and no less.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>There was no straying away into by-paths, no padding of words to make up\n",
    "for shortage of ideas, no superfluous and big-sounding phrases, no empty\n",
    "rhetoric or glittering generalities.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>How many speakers there are who aim at nothing and hit it. How many\n",
    "speakers there are who are on their way but do not know whither.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>If this directness of quality were applied to talking in business, in\n",
    "committee meetings, in telephone conversations, in public speaking, it\n",
    "would save annually in this country millions of words and incalculable\n",
    "time and energy.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>You will note that this speech has the rare quality of conciseness. We\n",
    "have an illustration here of how much a man can say in about 265 words\n",
    "and in the short space of two minutes, if he knows precisely what he\n",
    "wants to say.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>It is well to bear in mind that although this speech was scribbled off\n",
    "with seeming ease, Lincoln owed his ability to do it to a long and\n",
    "painstaking study of words and English style.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>He was a profound student of the dictionary. He steeped himself in\n",
    "words. He scrutinized words, he studied words, he made himself a master\n",
    "of words.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>This is a valuable habit for every man to form,—to study words\n",
    "regularly and earnestly, and to add consciously to his working\n",
    "vocabulary a few words daily—so in the course of a year such a man will\n",
    "acquire a large and varied stock of words which will do his instant\n",
    "bidding.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The conclusion is a vital part of a speech. It is a place of peril to\n",
    "many a public speaker. Countless speeches have been ruined by a bad\n",
    "conclusion.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The most important thing here is that having decided beforehand upon the\n",

    "a loose and straggling ending.</p>\n",

    "\n",
    "<p>The throat as a vital part of the public speaker's work in speaking is\n",
    "worthy of the greatest care and consideration. It is surprising that so\n",
    "little attention is given to vocal hygiene, when it is remembered that a\n",
    "serious weakness or affection of the throat may disqualify a speaker for\n",
    "important work. The delicate and intricate machinery of the vocal\n",
    "apparatus renders it peculiarly susceptible to misuse or exposure. The\n",
    "common defects of nasality, throatiness, and harshness, are due to wrong\n",
    "and careless use of the speaking-instrument.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>In the training of the public speaker the first step is to bring the\n",
    "breathing apparatus under proper control. That is to say, the speaker\n",
    "must accustom himself, through careful practise, to use the abdominal\n",
    "method of breathing, and to keep his throat free from the strain to\n",
    "which it is commonly subjected. This form of breathing is not difficult\n",
    "to acquire, since it simply means that during inhalation the abdomen is\n",
    "expanded, and during exhalation it is contracted. It should be no longer\n",
    "necessary to warn the speaker to breathe exclusively through the nose\n",
    "when not actually using the voice. While speaking he must so completely\n",
    "control the breath that not a particle of it can escape without giving\n",
    "up its equivalent in sound.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\"Clergyman's sore throat\" is the result of improper use or overstraining\n",
    "of the voice. Sometimes the earnestness of the preacher causes him to\n",
    "\"clutch\" each word with the vocal muscles, instead of using the throat\n",
    "as an open channel through which the voice may flow with ease and\n",
    "freedom. Many speakers, in an endeavor to be heard at a great distance,\n",
    "employ too loud a tone, forgetting that the essential thing is a clear\n",
    "and distinct articulation. To speak continuously in high pitch, or\n",
    "through half-closed teeth, almost invariably causes distress of throat.\n",
    "Most throat troubles may be set down to a lack of proper elocutionary\n",
    "training. To keep the voice and throat in order there should be regular\n",
    "daily practise, if only for ten minutes. The example might profitably\n",
    "be followed of certain actors who make a practise of humming\n",
    "occasionally during the day while engaged in other duties, as a means of\n",
    "keeping the voice musical and resonant.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>When the throat becomes husky or weak it is a timely warning from nature\n",
    "that it needs rest and relaxation. To continue to engage in public\n",
    "speaking under these circumstances is often attended with great danger,\n",
    "resulting sometimes in total loss of voice. It is economy in the end to\n",
    "discontinue the use of the voice when there is a serious cold or the\n",
    "throat is otherwise affected. Nervousness, anxiety, or unusual mental\n",
    "exertion may cause a vocal breakdown. For this condition rest is\n",
    "recommended, together with gentle massaging of the throat with cold\n",
    "water mixed with a little vinegar or <i>eau de Cologne</i>.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>A public speaker should not engage in protracted conversation\n",
    "immediately after a speech. The sudden transition from an auditorium to\n",
    "the outer air should remind the speaker to keep his mouth securely\n",
    "closed. The general physical condition of the speaker has much to do\n",
    "with the vigor and clearness of his voice. A daily plunge into cold\n",
    "water, or at least a sponging of the entire surface of the body, besides\n",
    "being a tonic luxury, greatly invigorates the throat and abdominal\n",
    "muscles. After the \"tub\" a vigorous rubbing with towel and hands should\n",
    "produce a glow.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>To the frequent question whether smoking is injurious to the throat, it\n",
    "is safe to say that the weight of authority and experience favors\n",
    "abstinence. Any one who has spoken for half an hour or more in a\n",
    "smoke-clouded room, knows the distressing effect it has had upon the\n",
    "sensitive lining of the throat. It must be obvious, therefore, that the\n",
    "constant inhaling of smoke must even more directly irritate the mucous\n",
    "membrane.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The diet of the public speaker should be reasonably moderate, and the\n",
    "extremes of hot and cold avoided. The use of ice-water is to be\n",
    "discouraged. Many drugs and lozenges are positively injurious to the\n",
    "throat. For habitual dryness of throat a glycerine or honey tablet will\n",
    "usually obviate the trouble. Dr. Morell Mackenzie, the eminent English\n",
    "throat specialist, condemns the use of alcohol as pernicious, and\n",
    "affirms that \"even in a comparatively mild form it keeps the delicate\n",
    "tissues in a state of congestion which makes them particularly liable to\n",
    "inflammation from cold or other causes.\"</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>It must not be assumed that the throat is to be pampered. A reasonable\n",
    "amount of exposure will harden it and to this extent is desirable. To\n",
    "muffle the throat with a scarf, unless demanded by special conditions,\n",
    "may make it unduly sensitive and increase the danger of taking cold when\n",
    "the head is turned from side to side.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>A leading physician confirms the opinion that the best gargle for daily\n",
    "use is that of warm water and salt. This should be used every night and\n",
    "morning to cleanse and invigorate the throat. Where there is a tendency\n",
    "to catarrh a solution made of peroxide of hydrogen, witch-hazel, and\n",
    "water, in equal parts, will prove efficacious. Nothing should be snuffed\n",
    "up the nose except under the direction of a physician, lest it cause\n",
    "deafness.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Many speakers and singers have a favorite nostrum for improving the\n",
    "voice. The long and amusing list includes hot milk, tea, coffee,\n",
    "champagne, raw eggs, lemonade, apples, raisins,—and sardines! A good\n",
    "rule is to eat sparingly if the meal is taken just before speaking. It\n",
    "need hardly be said that serious vocal defects, such as enlarged\n",
    "tonsils, elongated uvula, and abnormal growths in the throat and nose\n",
    "are subjects for the specialist.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Whenever possible a speaker should test beforehand the acoustic\n",
    "properties of the auditorium in which he is to speak for the first time.\n",
    "A helpful plan is to have a friend seat himself at the back of the hall\n",
    "or church, and give his opinion of the quality and projecting power of\n",
    "the speaker's voice. It is difficult to judge one's own voice because it\n",
    "is conveyed to him not only from the outside but also through the\n",
    "Eustachian tube and modified by the vibratory parts of the throat and\n",
    "head. A speaker never hears his own voice as it is heard by another.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Nothing, perhaps, is so taxing to the throat as long-continued speaking\n",
    "in one quality of tone. There are two distinct registers which should be\n",
    "judiciously alternated by the speaker. These are the \"chest\" register,\n",
    "in which the vocal cords vibrate their whole length, and the quality of\n",
    "tone derives most of its character from the chest cavity; and the \"head\"\n",
    "register, in which the vocal cords vibrate only in part, and the quality\n",
    "of tone is reenforced by the resonators of the face, mouth, and head.\n",
    "The first of these registers is sometimes called the \"orotund\" voice\n",
    "from its quality of roundness, and is employed principally in language\n",
    "of reverence, sublimity, and grandeur.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The head tone is the voice of ordinary conversation and should form the\n",
    "basis of the public-speaking style.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>No one who has to speak in public should be discouraged because of\n",
    "limited vocal resources. Many of the foremost orators began with marked\n",
    "disadvantages in this respect, but made these shortcomings an incentive\n",
    "to higher effort. One well-known speaker makes up for lack of vocal\n",
    "power by extreme distinctness of enunciation, while another offsets an\n",
    "unpleasantly heavy quality of voice by skilful modulation.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>A few easily remembered suggestions are:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p class=\"tbrk\">1. Rest the voice for an hour or two before speaking in public.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>2. Gargle the throat night and morning with salt and water.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>3. Never force the voice.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>4. Avoid all occasions that strain the voice, such as prolonged\n",
    "conversation, speaking against noise, or in cold and damp air.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>5. Practise deep breathing until it becomes an unconscious habit.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>6. Favor an outdoor life.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>7. Hum or sing a little every day.</p>\n",
