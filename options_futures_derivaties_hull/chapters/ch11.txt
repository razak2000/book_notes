There are six factors affecting the price of a stock option:
    1. The current stock price, S 0
    2. The strike price, K
    3. The time to expiration, T
    4. The volatility of the stock price, 
    5. The risk-free interest rate, r
    6. The dividends that are expected to be paid.

If a call option is exercised at some future time, the payoff will be the amount by which
the stock price exceeds the strike price. Call options therefore become more valuable as
the stock price increases and less valuable as the strike price increases.

For a put option,
the payoff on exercise is the amount by which the strike price exceeds the stock price.
Put options therefore behave in the opposite way from call options: they become less
valuable as the stock price increases and more valuable as the strike price increases.

Both put and call American options
become more valuable (or at least do not decrease in value) as the time to expiration
increases.

The long-life option must therefore
always be worth at least as much as the short-life option.

Although European put and call options usually become more valuable as the time
to expiration increases (see Figure 11.1e, f), this is not always the case.

The dividend will cause the stock price to decline, so that the short-life option
could be worth more than the long-life option

Roughly
speaking, the volatility of a stock price is a measure of how uncertain we are about
future stock price movements.

As volatility increases, the chance that the stock will do
very well or very poorly increases. For the owner of a stock, these two outcomes tend to
offset each other.

The owner of a
call benefits from price increases but has limited downside risk in the event of price
decreases because the most the owner can lose is the price of the option. Similarly, the
owner of a put benefits from price decreases, but has limited downside risk in the event
of price increases.

The values of both calls and puts therefore increase as volatility
increases

The risk-free interest rate affects the price of an option in a less clear-cut way.

As
interest rates in the economy increase, the expected return required by investors from
the stock tends to increase.

In addition, the present value of any future cash flow
received by the holder of the option decreases.

The combined impact of these two
effects is to increase the value of call options and decrease the value of put options

It is important to emphasize that we are assuming that interest rates change while all
other variables stay the same.
In practice, when interest rates rise
(fall), stock prices tend to fall (rise)

The combined effect of an interest rate increase and
the accompanying stock price decrease can be to decrease the value of a call option and
increase the value of a put option. Similarly, the combined effect of an interest rate
decrease and the accompanying stock price increase can be to increase the value of a
call option and decrease the value of a put option.

Dividends have the effect of reducing the stock price on the ex-dividend date. This is
bad news for the value of call options and good news for the value of put options.

Consider a dividend whose ex-dividend date is during the life of an option. The value of
the option is negatively related to the size of the dividend if the option is a call and
positively related to the size of the dividend if the option is a put.

11.2
We assume that there are some market participants,
such as large investment banks, for which the following statements are true:
    1. There are no transaction costs.
    2. All trading profits (net of trading losses) are subject to the same tax rate.
    3. Borrowing and lending are possible at the risk-free interest rate.

For the purposes of our
analysis, it is therefore reasonable to assume that there are no arbitrage opportunities.

It should be noted that r is the nominal risk-free rate of interest, not the real risk-free
rate of interest. The real rate of interest is the rate of interest earned after adjustment for the effects of inflation.

11.3
If an option price is above the upper bound or below the lower bound,
then there are profitable opportunities for arbitrageurs.

No matter what happens, the option can never be worth more
than the stock. Hence, the stock price is an upper bound to the option price:

No matter how low the stock price becomes, the option can never be worth more
than K.

For European options, we know that at maturity the option cannot be worth more
than K. It follows that it cannot be worth more than the present value of K today:

    p 6 Ke rT

A lower bound for the price of a European call option on a non-dividend-paying stock is
S 0  Ke rT


For a European put option on a non-dividend-paying stock, a lower bound for the
price is
Ke rT  S 0

11.4
We now derive an important relationship between the prices of European put and call
options that have the same strike price and time to maturity.

The components of portfolio A are worth c and Ke rT today, and the components of
portfolio C are worth p and S 0 today.

Hence,
c þ Ke rT 1⁄4 p þ S 0
This relationship is known as put–call parity

It shows that the value of a European call
with a certain exercise price and exercise date can be deduced from the value of a
European put with the same exercise price and exercise date, and vice versa.

Put–call parity holds only for European options. However, it is possible to derive some
results for American option prices.

It can be shown (see Problem 11.18) that, when
there are no dividends,
ð11:7Þ
S 0  K 6 C  P 6 S 0  Ke rT

11.5
In this section, we first show that it is never optimal to exercise an American call option
on a non-dividend-paying stock before the expiration date.

Because the owner of an American call has all the exercise opportunities open to the
owner of the corresponding European call, we must have C > c.

Hence,
C > S 0  Ke rT

Given r > 0, it follows that C > S 0  K when T > 0. This means that C is always greater
than the option’s intrinsic value prior to maturity. If it were optimal to exercise at a
particular time prior to maturity, C would equal the option’s intrinsic value at that
time. It follows that it can never be optimal to exercise early.

To summarize, there are two reasons an American call on a non-dividend-paying
stock should not be exercised early.

One relates to the insurance that it provides. A call
option, when held instead of the stock itself, in effect insures the holder against the
stock price falling below the strike price.
Once the option has been exercised and the
strike price has been exchanged for the stock price, this insurance vanishes.

The other
reason concerns the time value of money. From the perspective of the option holder,
the later the strike price is paid out the better.

Because American call options are never exercised early when there are no dividends,
they are equivalent to European call options, so that C 1⁄4 c

11.6
It can be optimal to exercise an American put option on a non-dividend-paying stock
early.

Indeed, at any given time during its life, the put option should always be exercised
early if it is sufficiently deep in the money.

Like a call option, a put option can be viewed as providing insurance.

A put option,
when held in conjunction with the stock, insures the holder against the stock price
falling below a certain level.

However, a put option is different from a call option in that
it may be optimal for an investor to forgo this insurance and exercise early in order to
realize the strike price immediately.

In general, the early exercise of a put option
becomes more attractive as S 0 decreases, as r increases, and as the volatility decreases.

From equations (11.3) and (11.5), lower and upper bounds for a European put option
when there are no dividends are given by
maxðKe rT  S 0 ; 0Þ 6 p 6 Ke rT

For an American put option on a non-dividend-paying stock, the condition
P > maxðK  S 0 ; 0Þ
must apply because the option can be exercised at any time.

Using the result
in equation (11.2), bounds for an American put option on a non-dividend-paying
stock are
maxðK  S 0 ; 0Þ 6 P 6 K

As we argued earlier, provided that r > 0, it is always optimal to exercise
an American put immediately when the stock price is sufficiently low.

When early
exercise is optimal, the value of the option is K  S 0 .

Because there are some circumstances when it is desirable to exercise an American
put option early, it follows that an American put option is always worth more than the
corresponding European put option.

Furthermore, because an American put is some-
times worth its intrinsic value (see Figure 11.6), it follows that a European put option
must sometimes be worth less than its intrinsic value.

This means that the curve
representing the relationship between the put price and the stock price for a European
option must be below the corresponding curve for an American option.

11.7
We assume that the dividends that will be paid during the life of the option
are known

A similar argument to the one used to derive equation (11.4) shows that
c > maxðS 0  D  Ke rT ; 0Þ

A similar argument to the one used to derive equation (11.5) shows that
p > maxðD þ Ke rT  S 0 ; 0Þ

When dividends are expected, we can no longer assert that an American call option will
not be exercised early.

Sometimes it is optimal to exercise an American call immediately
prior to an ex-dividend date. It is never optimal to exercise a call at other times.

Comparing the value at option maturity of the redefined portfolios A and C shows that,
with dividends, the put–call parity result in equation (11.6) becomes
c þ D þ Ke rT 1⁄4 p þ S 0

Dividends cause equation (11.7) to be modified (see Problem 11.19) to
S 0  D  K 6 C  P 6 S 0  Ke rT

SUMMARY
There are six factors affecting the value of a stock option: the current stock price, the
strike price, the time to expiration, the stock price volatility, the risk-free interest rate,
and the dividends expected during the life of the option.

The value of a call usually
increases as the current stock price, the time to expiration, the volatility, and the risk-
free interest rate increase.

The value of a call decreases as the strike price and expected
dividends increase.

he value of a put usually increases as the strike price, the time to
expiration, the volatility, and the expected dividends increase.

The value of a put
decreases as the current stock price and the risk-free interest rate increase.

A European call option on a non-dividend-paying stock must be worth more than
maxðS 0  Ke rT ; 0Þ

A European put option on a non-dividend-paying stock must be
worth more than
maxðKe rT  S 0 ; 0Þ

When dividends with present value D will be paid, the lower bound for a European call
option becomes
maxðS 0  D  Ke rT ; 0Þ
and the lower bound for a European put option becomes
maxðKe rT þ D  S 0 ; 0Þ

Put–call parity is a relationship between the price, c, of a European call option on a
stock and the price, p, of a European put option on a stock.

For a non-dividend-paying
stock, it is
c þ Ke rT 1⁄4 p þ S 0

For a dividend-paying stock, the put–call parity relationship is
c þ D þ Ke rT 1⁄4 p þ S 0

Put–call parity does not hold for American options. However, it is possible to use
arbitrage arguments to obtain upper and lower bounds for the difference between the
price of an American call and the price of an American put.
