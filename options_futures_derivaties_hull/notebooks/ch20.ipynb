    "\n",
    "As explained in earlier chapters, <font color='blue'> put–call parity provides a relationship </font>  between the\n",
    "prices of European call and put options when they have the same strike price and time\n",
    "to maturity. With a dividend yield on the underlying asset of q, the relationship is\n",
    "$$p + S_0e^{-qT} = c + Ke^{-rT} \\tag{20.1}$$\n",
    "As usual, c and p are the European call and put price. They have the same strike\n",

    "A <font color='blue'> key feature of the put–call parity </font>  relationship is that it is <font color='blue'> based on a relatively\n",

    "asset price has a lognormal distribution at future times. This is equivalent to the\n",
    "assumption that asset price changes over a short period of time, such as one day, are\n",
    "normally distributed. Suppose that most market participants are comfortable with the\n",
    "Black–Scholes–Merton assumptions for exchange rates. You have just done the\n",
    "analysis in Table 20.1 and know that the lognormal assumption is not a good one\n",
    "for exchange rates. What should you do?\n",
    "The answer is that you should buy deep-out-of-the-money call and put options on\n",
    "a variety of different currencies and wait. These options will be relatively inexpensive\n",
    "and more of them will close in the money than the lognormal model predicts. The\n",
    "present value of your payoffs will on average be much greater than the cost of the\n",
    "options.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the mid-1980s, a few traders knew about the heavy tails of foreign exchange\n",
    "probability distributions. Everyone else thought that the lognormal assumption of\n",
    "Black–Scholes–Merton was reasonable. The few traders who were well informed\n",

    "\n",
    "Daily changes exceed 3 standard deviations on 1.30% of days. The lognormal model\n",

    "1. The volatility of the asset is constant.\n",
    "2. The price of the asset changes smoothly with no jumps.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, neither of these conditions is satisfied for an exchange rate. The volatility of\n",
    "an exchange rate is far from constant, and exchange rates frequently exhibit jumps,\n",
    "sometimes in response to the actions of central banks. It turns out that both a\n",
    "nonconstant volatility and jumps will have the effect of making extreme outcomes\n",
    "more likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "The impact of jumps and nonconstant volatility depends on the option maturity. As\n",
    "the maturity of the option is increased, the percentage impact of a nonconstant\n",

    "volatility usually becomes less pronounced. The percentage impact of jumps on both\n",

    "## 20.3 EQUITY OPTIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to the crash of 1987, there was no marked volatility smile for equity options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since 1987, the volatility smile used by traders to price equity options (both on\n",
    "individual stocks and on stock indices) has had the general form shown in Figure 20.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is sometimes referred to as a volatility skew. The volatility decreases as the strike\n",
    "price increases. The volatility used to price a low-strike-price option (i.e., a deep-out-\n",
    "of-the-money put or a deep-in-the-money call) is significantly higher than that used to\n",
    "price a high-strike-price option (i.e., a deep-in-the-money put or a deep-out-of-the-\n",
    "money call).\n",
    "\n",
    "The volatility smile for equity options corresponds to the implied probability dis-\n",

    "lognormal distribution is used. This is because the option pays off only if the stock\n",

    "\n",
    "The Reason for the Smile in Equity Options\n",
    "There is a negative correlation between equity prices and volatility. As prices move\n",
    "down (up), volatilities tend to move up (down). There are several possible reasons for\n",
    "this. One concerns leverage. As equity prices move down (up), leverage increases\n",
    "(decreases) and as a result volatility increases (decreases). Another is referred to as\n",
    "the volatility feedback effect. As volatility increases (decreases) because of external\n",
    "factors, investors require a higher (lower) return and as a result the stock price declines\n",
    "(increases). A further explanation is crashophobia (see Business Snapshot 20.2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever the reason for the negative correlation, it means that stock price declines\n",
    "are accompanied by increases in volatility, making even greater declines possible. Stock\n",
    "price increases are accompanied by decreases in volatility, making further stock price\n",
    "increases less likely. This explains the heavy left tail and thin right tail of the implied\n",
    "distribution in Figure 20.4.\n",
    "437\n",
    "Business Snapshot 20.2 Crashophobia\n",
    "It is interesting that the pattern in Figure 20.3 for equities has existed only since the\n",
    "stock market crash of October 1987. Prior to October 1987, implied volatilities were\n",
    "much less dependent on strike price. This has led Mark Rubinstein to suggest that\n",
    "one reason for the equity volatility smile may be ‘‘crashophobia.’’ Traders are\n",
    "concerned about the possibility of another crash similar to October 1987, and they\n",
    "price options accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is some empirical support for this explanation. Declines in the S&P 500 tend\n",
    "to be accompanied by a steepening of the volatility skew. When the S&P increases,\n",
    "the skew tends to become less steep.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 20.4 ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF CHARACTERIZING THE\n",
    "\n",
    "VOLATILITY SMILE\n",
    "There are a number of ways of characterizing the volatility smile. Sometimes it is shown\n",
    "as the relationship between implied volatility and strike price K. However, this relation-\n",
    "ship depends on the price of the asset. As the price of the asset increases (decreases), the\n",
    "central at-the-money strike price increases (decreases) so that the curve relating the\n",
    "implied volatility to the strike price moves to right (left). 3 For this reason the implied\n",
    "volatility is often plotted as a function of the strike price divided by the current asset\n",
    "price, K=S 0 . This is what we have done Figures 20.1 and 20.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "A refinement of this is to calculate the volatility smile as the relationship between the\n",
    "implied volatility and K=F 0 , where F 0 is the forward price of the asset for a contract\n",
    "maturing at the same time as the options that are considered. Traders also often define\n",
    "an ‘‘at-the-money’’ option as an option where K 1⁄4 F 0 , not as an option where K 1⁄4 S_0 .\n",
    "\n",
    "The argument for this is that F 0 , not S_0 , is the expected stock price on the option’s\n",
    "maturity date in a risk-neutral world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet another approach to defining the volatility smile is as the relationship between the\n",
    "implied volatility and the delta of the option (where delta is defined as in Chapter 19).\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach sometimes makes it possible to apply volatility smiles to options other\n",
    "than European and American calls and puts. When the approach is used, an at-the-\n",
    "money option is then defined as a call option with a delta of 0.5 or a put option with a\n",
    "delta of -0.5. These are referred to as ‘‘50-delta options.’’\n",

    "expected to happen. Consider, for example, a stock or stock index option. The volatility\n",
    "smile has the shape shown in Figure 20.3. Two phenomenon can be identified:\n",
    "1. As the equity price increases (decreases), K=S 0 decreases (increases) and the\n",
    "volatility increases (decreases). In other words, the option moves up the curve\n",
    "in Figure 20.3 when the equity price increases and down the curve when the equity\n",
    "price decreases.\n",
    "2. There is a negative correlation between equity prices and their volatilities. When\n",
    "the equity price increases, the whole curve in Figure 20.3 tends to move down;\n",
    "when the equity price decreases, the whole curve in Figure 20.3 tends to move up.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that the second effect dominates the first, so that implied volatilities tend to\n",
    "move down (up) when the equity price moves up (down) The delta that takes this\n",
    "relationship between implied volatilities and equity prices into account is referred to as\n",
    "the minimum variance delta. It is:\n",

    "## 20.7 THE ROLE OF THE MODEL\n",
    "\n",
    "How important is the option-pricing model if traders are prepared to use a different\n",
    "volatility for every option? It can be argued that the Black–Scholes–Merton model is\n",
    "no more than a sophisticated interpolation tool used by traders for ensuring that an\n",
    "option is priced consistently with the market prices of other actively traded options. If\n",
    "traders stopped using Black–Scholes–Merton and switched to another plausible model,\n",
    "then the volatility surface and the shape of the smile would change, but arguably the\n",
    "dollar prices quoted in the market would not change appreciably. Greek letters and\n",
    "therefore hedging strategies do depend on the model used. An unrealistic model is liable\n",
    "to lead to poor hedging.\n",
    "4\n",
    "For a further discussion of this, see, for example, J. C. Hull and A. White, ‘‘Optimal Delta Hedging of\n",
    "Options,’’ Working paper, University of Toronto, 2016.440\n",
    "CHAPTER 20\n",
    "Models have most effect on the pricing of derivatives when similar derivatives do not\n",
    "trade actively in the market. For example, the pricing of many of the nonstandard\n",
    "exotic derivatives we will discuss in later chapters is model-dependent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 20.8 WHEN A SINGLE LARGE JUMP IS ANTICIPATED\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now consider an example of how an unusual volatility smile might arise in equity\n",
    "markets. Suppose that a stock price is currently $50 and an important news announce-\n",
    "ment due in a few days is expected either to increase the stock price by $8 or to reduce it\n",
    "by $8. (This announcement could concern the outcome of a takeover attempt or the\n",
    "verdict in an important lawsuit.) The probability distribution of the stock price in, say,\n",
    "1 month might then consist of a mixture of two lognormal distributions, the first\n",
    "corresponding to favorable news, the second to unfavorable news. The situation is\n",
    "illustrated in Figure 20.5. The solid line shows the mixture-of-lognormals distribution\n",
    "for the stock price in 1 month; the dashed line shows a lognormal distribution with the\n",
    "same mean and standard deviation as this distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The true probability distribution is bimodal (certainly not lognormal). One easy way\n",
    "to investigate the general effect of a bimodal stock price distribution is to consider the\n",
    "extreme case where there are only two possible future stock prices. This is what we will\n",
    "now do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that the stock price is currently $50 and that it is known that in 1 month it\n",
    "will be either $42 or $58. Suppose further that the risk-free rate is 12% per annum. The\n",
    "situation is illustrated in Figure 20.6. Options can be valued using the binomial model\n",
    "from Chapter 13. In this case u 1⁄4 1:16, d 1⁄4 0:84, a 1⁄4 1:0101, and p 1⁄4 0:5314. The\n",
    "results from valuing a range of different options are shown in Table 20.3. The first\n",
    "column shows alternative strike prices; the second column shows prices of 1-month\n",
    "European call options; the third column shows the prices of one-month European put\n",
    "option prices; the fourth column shows implied volatilities. (As shown in Section 20.1,\n",

    "a heavier right tail and a heavier left tail than the lognormal distribution.\n",
