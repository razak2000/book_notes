    "Since the seminal works of Black-Scholes-Merton in 1973, the world of finance has been\n",
    "revolutionized by the emergence of a new field known as financial engineering. On the one\n",
    "hand, markets (foreign exchange, interest rate, commodities, etc.) have become more volatile,\n",
    "which creates an increase in the demand for derivatives products (options, forwards, futures,\n",
    "swaps, hybrids and exotics, and credit derivatives to name a few) used to measure, control,\n",
    "and manage risks, as well as to speculate and take advantage of arbitrage opportunities.\n",
    "On the other hand, technological advances have enabled financial institutions and other mar-\n",
    "kets players to create, price and launch new products and services to not only hedge against\n",
    "risks, but also to generate revenues from these risks. In addition to a deep grasp of advanced\n",
    "financial theories, the design, analysis and development of these complex products and finan-\n",
    "cial services, or financial engineering, necessitate a mastering of sophisticated mathematics,\n",
    "statistics and numerical computations.\n",
    "By way of an integrated approach, the object of this book is to teach the reader:\n",
    "r to apply stochastic calculus and simulation techniques to solve financial problems;\n",
    "r to develop and/or adapt the existing contingent claims models to support financial engineer-\n",
    "ing platforms and applications.\n",
    "There are several books in the market covering stochastic calculus and Monte Carlo simulations\n",
    "in finance. These books can be roughly grouped into two categories: introductory or advanced.\n",
    "Unfortunately, the books at the introductory level do not answer the needs of upper-level\n",
    "undergraduate and graduate students and finance professionals and practitioners. Advanced\n",
    "books, being very sophisticated and specialized, are tailored for researchers and users with\n",
    "solid and esoteric scientific backgrounds in mathematics and statistics. Furthermore, these\n",
    "books are often biased towards the research interests of the authors, hence their scope is\n",
    "narrowed and their applications in finance limited. By and large, the existing books are less\n",
    "suitable for day-to-day use which is why there is a need for a book that can be used equally by\n",
    "beginners and established researchers wishing to acquire an adequate knowledge of stochastic\n",
    "processes and simulation techniques and to learn how to formulate and solve problems in\n",
    "finance.\n",
    "This book, which has developed from the master programme in financial engineering at\n",
    "Laval University in Canada first offered in 1999, aims to reinforce several aspects of simulation\n",
    "techniques and their applications in finance. Building on an integrated approach, the bookxiv\n",
    "Preface\n",
    "provides a pedagogical treatment of the material for senior undergrad and graduate students as\n",
    "well as professionals working in risk management and financial engineering. While initiating\n",
    "students into basic concepts, it covers current up-to-date problems. It is written in a clear,\n",
    "concise and rigorous pedagogical language, which widens accessibility to a larger audience\n",
    "without sacrificing mathematical rigor. By way of a gradual learning of existing theories and\n",
    "new developments, our goal is also to provide an approach to help the reader follow the relevant\n",
    "literature which continually expands at a rapid pace.\n",
    "This book is intended for students in business, economics, actuarial sciences, computer\n",
    "sciences, general sciences, and engineering, programmers and practitioners in financial, in-\n",
    "vestment/asset and risk management industries. The prerequisites for the book are some\n",
    "familiarity in linear algebra, differential calculus and programming.\n",
    "The book introduces and trains users in the formulation and resolution of financial problems.\n",
    "As exercises, it provides computer programs for use with the practical examples, exercises and\n",
    "case studies, which give the reader specific recipes for solving problems involving stochastic\n",
    "R 1\n",
    "software which is easy\n",
    "processes in finance. The programming language is the MATLAB \u0002\n",
    "to learn and popular among professionals and practitioners. Moreover, the programs could be\n",
    "readily converted for use with the platform C++. Note that, unlike the MATLAB financial\n",
    "toolboxes which are still limited in scope, our proposed exercises and case studies tackle the\n",
    "complex problems encountered routinely in finance.\n",
    "Overall, the general philosophy of the book can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "r keep mathematical rigor by minimizing abstracts and unnecessary jargon;\n",
    "r each concept, either in finance or in computation, leads to algorithms and is illustrated by\n",
    "concrete examples in finance.\n",
    "Therefore, after they are discussed, the topics are presented in algorithmic forms. Furthermore,\n",
    "some of the examples which treat current financial problems are expounded in case studies,\n",
    "enabling students to better comprehend the underlying financial theory and related quantitative\n",
    "methods.\n",
    "Every effort has been made to structure the chapters in a logical and coherent manner, with\n",
    "a clear thread and linkage between the chapters which is not apparent in most existing books.\n",
    "Each chapter has been written with regard to the following four principles: pedagogy, rigor,\n",
    "relevance and application. Advanced readers can skip the chapters they are familiar with and\n",
    "go straight to those of interest.\n",
    "The book starts with a refresher of basic probability and statistics which underpin random\n",
    "processes and computer simulation techniques introduced later. Most of the developed tools\n",
    "are used later to study computational problems of derivative products and risk management.\n",
    "The text is divided into the following four major parts. The first part (Chapters 1 to 3) reviews\n",
    "basic probability and statistics principles. The second part (Chapters 4 to 6) introduces the\n",
    "Monte Carlo and Quasi Monte Carlo simulations topics and techniques. In addition to the\n",
    "other commonly used variance reduction techniques, we introduce the quadratic resampling\n",
    "technique of Barraquand (1995) to obtain the prescribed distribution characteristics of the\n",
    "simulated samples, which is important to improve the quality of the simulations. We also\n",

    "# Introduction to Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Since financial markets are very volatile, in order to model financial variables we need to char-\n",
    "acterize randomness. Therefore, to study financial phenomena, we have to use probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once defined, we will see how to use probabilities to describe the evolution of random\n",
    "parameters that we later call random processes. The key step here is the quantitative construc-\n",
    "tion of the events’ probabilities. First, one must define the events and then the probabilities\n",
    "associated to these events. This is the objective of this first chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 INTUITIVE EXPLANATION\n",
    "### 1.1.1 Frequencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example to illustrate the notion of relative frequency. We toss a dice N times and\n",
    "observe the outcomes. We suppose that the 6 faces are identified by letters A, B, C, D, E and F.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in the probability of obtaining face A. For that purpose, we count the number\n",
    "of times that face A appears and denote it by n(A). This number represents the frequency of\n",
    "appearance of face A.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, we see that the division of the number of times that face A appears, n(A), by the\n",
    ", is a fraction that represents the probability of obtaining face\n",
    "total number N of throws, n(A)\n",
    "N\n",
    "A each time that we toss the dice. In the first series of experiments when we toss the dice N\n",
    "times we get n 1 (A) and if we repeat this series of experiments another time by tossing it again\n",
    "N times, we obtain n 2 (A) of outcomes A.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is likely that n 1 (A) and n 2 (A) are different. The fractions n 1 N (A) and n 2 N (A) are then different.\n",
    "Therefore, how can we say that this fraction quantifies the probability of obtaining face A? To\n",
    "find an answer, we need to continue the experiment. Even if the fractions are different, when\n",
    "the number N of throws becomes very large, we observe that these two fractions converge to\n",
    "the same value of 16 .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, this fraction measures the probability of obtaining face A, and when N is large,\n",
    "this fraction goes to 16 . Thus, each time we toss the dice, it is natural to take 16 as the probability\n",
    "of obtaining face A.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, we will see that from the law of large numbers these fractions converge to this limit.\n",
    "This limit, 16 , corresponds to the concept of the ratio of the number of favorable cases over the\n",
    "total number of cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.2 Number of Favorable Cases Over The Total Number of Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "When we toss a dice, there is a total of 6 possible outcomes, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, corresponding\n",
    "to the letters on faces {A, B, C, D, E, F}. If we wish to obtain face A and we have only one\n",
    "such case, then the probability of getting face A is quantified by the fraction 16 . However, we\n",
    "may be interested in the event {“the observed face is even”}. What does this mean? The even\n",
    "face can be 2, 4 or 6. Each time that one of these three faces appears, we have a realization of\n",
    "the event {“the observed face is even”}. This means that when we toss a dice, the total number\n",
    "of possible cases is always 6 and the number of favorable cases associated to even events is 3.\n",
    "Therefore, the probability of obtaining an even face is simply 36 and intuitively this appears to\n",
    "be correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From this consideration, in the following section we construct in an axiomatic way the\n",
    "mechanics of what is happening. However, we must first establish what is an event, and then\n",
    "we must define the probabilities associated with an event.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 AXIOMATIC DEFINITION\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s define an universe in which we can embed all these intuitive considerations in an\n",
    "axiomatic way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.1 Random Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "A random experiment is an experiment in which we cannot precisely predict the outcome.\n",
    "Each result obtained from this experiment is random a priori (before the realization of the\n",
    "experiment). Each of these results is called a simple event. This means that each time that we\n",
    "realize this experiment we can obtain only one simple event. Further we say that all simple\n",
    "events are exclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2.1 Tossing a dice is a random experiment because before the toss, we cannot\n",
    "exactly predict the future result. The face that is shown can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. Each of\n",
    "these results is thus a simple event. All these 6 simple events are mutually exclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We denote by Ω the set of all simple events. The number of elements in Ω can be finite,\n",
    "countably infinite, uncountably infinite, etc. The example with the dice corresponds to the first\n",
    "case (the case of a “finite number of results”, Ω = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2.2 We count the number of phone calls to one center during one hour. The\n",
    "number of calls can be 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. up to infinity. An infinite number of calls is evidently\n",
    "an event that will never occur. However, to consider it in the theoretical development\n",
    "allows us to build useful models in a relatively simple fashion. This phone calls example\n",
    "corresponds to the countably infinite case (Ω = { 0, 1, 2, 3, . . ., ∞}).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2.3 When we throw a marble on the floor of a room, the position on which the\n",
    "marble will stop is a simple event of the experiment. However, the number of simple events\n",
    "is infinite and uncountable. It corresponds to the set of all points on the floor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a probability theory for the case of finite experiments is relatively easy, the gener-\n",
    "alization to the countably infinite case is straightforward. However, the uncountably infinite\n",
    "case is different. We will point out these differences and technicalities but we will not dwell\n",
    "on the complex mathematical aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.2 Event\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider the experiment of a dice toss. We want to study the “even face” event. This event\n",
    "happens when the face shown is even, that is, one of 2, 4, or 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we can say that this event “even face” contains three simple events {2, 4, 6}. This\n",
    "brings us to the definition:\n",
